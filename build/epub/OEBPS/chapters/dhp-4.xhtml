<h1 id="flowers">Flowers</h1>

<p>44.<br />
Who is it<br />
that can truly see as they are<br />
this earth, this body,<br />
the hell realms and the heavenly realms?<br />
Who can discern<br />
the well-taught Path of Wisdom,<br />
in the way the eye of a skilled florist<br />
can select perfect blooms?</p>

<p>45.<br />
It is those who knowingly walk the Way<br />
who can see as they truly are<br />
this earth, this body,<br />
the hell realms and the heavenly realms.<br />
These are the ones who can discern<br />
the well-taught Path of Wisdom.</p>

<p>46.<br />
Know the body<br />
to be as transient as foam, a mirage.<br />
The flower of sensual passion<br />
has a hidden barb.<br />
See this and pass beyond death.</p>

<p>47.<br />
As a flash flood<br />
can sweep away a sleeping village,<br />
so death can destroy<br />
those who only seek the flowers<br />
of casual sensual pleasures.</p>

<p>48.<br />
To be frustrated and ungratified,<br />
yet still only seek the flowers<br />
of casual sensual pleasures<br />
brings one under the destroyerâ€™s sway.</p>

<p>49.<br />
As a bee gathering nectar<br />
does not harm or disturb<br />
the colour and fragrance of the flower,<br />
so do the wise move<br />
through the world.</p>

<p>50.<br />
Dwell not on the faults<br />
and shortcomings of others,<br />
instead, seek clarity<br />
about your own.</p>

<p>51.<br />
As a beautiful flower<br />
without fragrance is disappointing,<br />
so are wise words<br />
without right action.</p>

<p>52.<br />
As a beautiful flower<br />
with a delightful fragrance is pleasing,<br />
so is wise and lovely speech<br />
when matched with right action.</p>

<p>53.<br />
As many garlands can be made<br />
from a heap of flowers,<br />
so too much that is wholesome can be done<br />
during this human existence.</p>

<p>54.<br />
The fragrance of flowers or sandalwood<br />
blows only with the prevailing wind,<br />
but the fragrance of virtue<br />
pervades all directions.</p>

<p>55.<br />
The fragrance of virtue<br />
surpasses by far<br />
the fragrance of flowers<br />
or sandalwood.</p>

<p>56.<br />
The aroma of sandalwood<br />
and the scent of flowers<br />
bring only little delight<br />
compared to the fragrance of virtue,<br />
which suffuses even the heavenly realms.</p>

<p>57.<br />
It is not possible for Mara to find<br />
those who abide in appreciative awareness,<br />
who by perfect knowledge are freed<br />
and live in virtue.</p>

<p>58-59.<br />
Just as a sweet-smelling and beautiful lotus<br />
can grow from a pile of discarded waste,<br />
the radiance of a true disciple of the Buddha<br />
outshines dark shadows cast by ignorance.</p>
