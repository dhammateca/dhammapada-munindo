<p>146.<br />
Why is there laughter?<br />
Why is there joy<br />
when the world is on fire?<br />
Since you are clouded in darkness<br />
should you not seek the light?</p>

<p>147.<br />
Gaze upon this once-decorated body â€“<br />
it used to attract attention<br />
but now it is only festering flesh,<br />
a putrid thing.<br />
It is neither sure nor substantial.</p>

<p>148.<br />
This body wears out with age;<br />
it becomes a host to disease<br />
- vulnerable, fragile,<br />
a decrepit, disintegrating mass,<br />
which eventually ends in death.</p>

<p>149.<br />
What pleasure does life hold<br />
once one has seen<br />
old bleached bones<br />
discarded and scattered round?</p>

<p>150.<br />
The physical body consists of bones<br />
covered with flesh and blood.<br />
Stored up inside it<br />
are decay and death, pride and malice.</p>

<p>151.<br />
Passed down by the wise<br />
is the knowledge that<br />
though what is externally impressive<br />
loses its splendour,<br />
and though our bodies will decay,<br />
the truth itself outlasts all degeneration.</p>

<p>152.<br />
While ageing fools put on weight<br />
like oxen in their stalls,<br />
their minds remain small.</p>

<p>153-154.<br />
For many lives I have wandered<br />
looking for, but not finding,<br />
the house-builder<br />
who caused my suffering.<br />
But now you are seen and<br />
you shall build no more.<br />
Your rafters are dislodged and<br />
the ridge-pole is broken.<br />
All craving is ended;<br />
my heart is as one with the unmade.</p>

<p>155.<br />
Those who, while still young,<br />
neither choose a life of renunciation<br />
nor earn a good living,<br />
end up like dejected old herons<br />
beside a pond without fish.</p>

<p>156.<br />
Those who, while still young,<br />
neither choose a life of renunciation<br />
nor earn a good living,<br />
will end up bemoaning the past,<br />
falling like spent arrows<br />
that have missed their mark.</p>
