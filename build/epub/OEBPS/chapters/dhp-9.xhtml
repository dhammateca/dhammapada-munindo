<h1 id="evil">Evil</h1>

<p>116.<br />
Hasten towards doing what is wholesome.<br />
Restrain your mind from evil acts.<br />
The mind that is slow to do good<br />
can easily find pleasure in evil-doing.</p>

<p>117.<br />
If you perform an evil act,<br />
then do not repeat it.<br />
Avoid finding pleasure in its memory.<br />
The aftermath of evil-doing is painful.</p>

<p>118.<br />
Having performed a wholesome act<br />
it is good to repeat it.<br />
Enjoy the pleasure of its memory.<br />
The fruit of goodness is contentment.</p>

<p>119.<br />
Even those who perform evil<br />
can experience well-being<br />
so long as their actions<br />
have not yet borne direct fruits.<br />
However, when the results<br />
of their actions ripen,<br />
the painful consequences<br />
cannot be avoided.</p>

<p>120.<br />
Even those who live wholesome lives<br />
can experience suffering<br />
so long as their acts<br />
have not yet borne direct fruit.<br />
However, when the fruits<br />
of their actions ripen,<br />
the joyful consequences<br />
cannot be avoided.</p>

<p>121.<br />
Do not ignore the effects of evil,<br />
saying, “This will come to nothing.”<br />
Just as by the gradual fall of raindrops<br />
the water jar is filled,<br />
so in time fools are corrupted<br />
by evil-doing.</p>

<p>122.<br />
Do not ignore the effect of right action<br />
saying, “This will come to nothing.”<br />
Just as by the gradual fall of raindrops<br />
the water jar is filled,<br />
so in time the wise<br />
become replete with good.</p>

<p>123.<br />
As a trader with valuable cargo avoids threat<br />
and those who love life avoid poison,<br />
so you should avoid evil actions.</p>

<p>124.<br />
A hand without an open wound<br />
can carry poison<br />
and remain free from harm;<br />
likewise, evil has no consequences<br />
for those who do not perform it.</p>

<p>125.<br />
If you intentionally harm<br />
an innocent person,<br />
someone who is pure and blameless,<br />
the harm will come back to you<br />
like fine dust thrown into the wind.</p>

<p>126.<br />
Some are reborn as humans;<br />
evil-doers are reborn in hell.<br />
Doers of good are reborn in bliss<br />
and the pure enter the trackless land.</p>

<p>127.<br />
There is no place on earth<br />
where one can hide<br />
from the consequences of evil actions –<br />
not in a mountain cave,<br />
the ocean, nor in the sky.</p>

<p>128.<br />
There is no place on earth<br />
beyond the reach of death –<br />
not in a mountain cave,<br />
the ocean, nor in the sky.</p>
