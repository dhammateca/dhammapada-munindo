<h1 id="the-path">The Path</h1>

<p>273.<br />
The Eightfold Path<br />
is the most honourable way,<br />
the Four Noble Truths<br />
the most honourable utterance,<br />
freedom from craving<br />
the most honourable state,<br />
and the all-seeing Buddha<br />
the most honourable being.</p>

<p>274.<br />
This is the only Way;<br />
there is no other<br />
that leads to clear seeing.<br />
Follow this Way<br />
and Mara becomes disoriented.</p>

<p>275.<br />
If you walk the path<br />
you will arrive at the end of suffering.<br />
Having beheld this myself,<br />
I proclaim the Way<br />
which removes all thorns.</p>

<p>276.<br />
The Awakened Ones<br />
can but point the way;<br />
we must make the effort ourselves.<br />
Those who reflect wisely<br />
and enter the path are freed<br />
from the fetters of Mara.</p>

<p>277.<br />
“All conditioned things<br />
are impermanent”;<br />
when we see this with insight<br />
we will tire of this life of suffering.<br />
This is the Way to purification.</p>

<p>278.<br />
“All conditioned things<br />
are inherently lacking”;<br />
when we see this with insight<br />
we will tire of this life of suffering.<br />
This is the Way to purification.</p>

<p>279.<br />
“All realities are devoid<br />
of an abiding self”;<br />
when we see this with insight<br />
we will tire of this life of suffering.<br />
This is the Way to purification.</p>

<p>280.<br />
If, while still young and strong,<br />
you procrastinate<br />
when you should act,<br />
indulging in heedless fantasies,<br />
the Way and its wisdom<br />
will never become clear.</p>

<p>281.<br />
Be careful in what you say,<br />
restrained in what you think,<br />
and impeccable in how you act.<br />
Purifying these three ways of behaviour<br />
will take you along the Way of the sages.</p>

<p>282.<br />
To contemplate life leads to wisdom;<br />
without contemplation wisdom wanes.<br />
Recognize how wisdom<br />
is cultivated and destroyed,<br />
and walk the Way of increase.</p>

<p>283.<br />
Clear away the forests of craving,<br />
but do not attack and destroy the trees.<br />
Clear the entire forest of craving<br />
and you will see the Way to freedom.</p>

<p>284.<br />
So long as sexual attraction<br />
has not been cleared away,<br />
if even the slightest trace remains,<br />
the heart is held in dependence<br />
like a suckling calf to a cow.</p>

<p>285.<br />
Remove the bonds of affection<br />
as one might pluck an autumn flower.<br />
Walk the Way that leads to liberation,<br />
explained by the Awakened One.</p>

<p>286.<br />
It is a fool<br />
who indulges in dreaming<br />
about the most comfortable<br />
place to live, saying,<br />
“Here it will be warm,<br />
there it will be cool” –<br />
unaware of impending death.</p>

<p>287.<br />
As a flood could sweep away<br />
an entire village,<br />
those who are caught up<br />
in relationships and possessions<br />
will be carried away by death.</p>

<p>288-289.<br />
As you approach death<br />
none of your fond attachments<br />
will protect you.<br />
See this, then with wise restraint<br />
and unwavering effort,<br />
hasten to clear your path to liberation.</p>
