<h1 id="happiness">Happiness</h1>

<p>197.<br />
While in the midst<br />
of those who hate,<br />
to dwell free from hating<br />
is happiness indeed.</p>

<p>198.<br />
While in the midst<br />
of those who are troubled,<br />
to dwell free from trouble<br />
is happiness indeed.</p>

<p>199.<br />
While in the midst<br />
of those who are greedy,<br />
to dwell free from greed<br />
is happiness indeed.</p>

<p>200.<br />
We dwell happily,<br />
free from anxiety;<br />
like radiant beings<br />
in celestial realms<br />
we rejoice in delight.</p>

<p>201.<br />
Victory leads to hatred,<br />
for the defeated suffer.<br />
The peaceful live happily,<br />
beyond victory and defeat.</p>

<p>202.<br />
There is no fire like lust,<br />
no distress like hatred,<br />
no pain like the burden of attachment,<br />
no joy like the peace of liberation.</p>

<p>203.<br />
Hunger is the greatest affliction,<br />
conditionality the greatest<br />
source of despair.<br />
The wise, seeing this as it is,<br />
realise liberation, the greatest joy.</p>

<p>204.<br />
A healthy mind is the greatest gain.<br />
Contentment is the greatest wealth.<br />
Trustworthiness is the best of kin.<br />
Unconditional freedom is the highest bliss.</p>

<p>205.<br />
Tasting the flavour of solitude<br />
and the nectar of peace,<br />
those who drink the joy<br />
that is the essence of reality<br />
abide free from fear of evil.</p>

<p>206.<br />
It is always a pleasure<br />
not to have to encounter fools.<br />
It is always good to see noble beings,<br />
and a delight to live with them.</p>

<p>207.<br />
Tedious is the company of fools,<br />
always painful, like being<br />
surrounded by enemies;<br />
but to associate with the wise<br />
is like being at home.</p>

<p>208.<br />
You should follow the ways<br />
of those who are steadfast,<br />
discerning, pure and aware,<br />
just as the moon follows<br />
the path of the stars.</p>
