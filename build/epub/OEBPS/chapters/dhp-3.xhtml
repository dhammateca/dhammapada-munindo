<h1 id="the-mind">The Mind</h1>

<p>33.<br />
Just as a fletcher shapes an arrow,<br />
so the wise develop the mind,<br />
so excitable, uncertain<br />
and difficult to control.</p>

<p>34.<br />
As a fish which on being dragged<br />
from its home in the water<br />
and tossed on dry land<br />
will thrash about,<br />
so will the heart tremble<br />
when withdrawing from the current of Mara.</p>

<p>35.<br />
The active mind is difficult to tame,<br />
flighty and wandering wherever it wills:<br />
taming it is essential,<br />
leading to the joy of well-being.</p>

<p>36.<br />
The protected and guarded mind<br />
leads to ease of being.<br />
Though this mind is subtle,<br />
elusive and difficult to see,<br />
one who is alert should tend<br />
and watch over it.</p>

<p>37.<br />
Wandering far and wide on its own,<br />
without form,<br />
the mind lies in the heart-cavern within.<br />
To bring it under control<br />
is to be freed from the bonds of ignorance.</p>

<p>38.<br />
In one whose mind is unsteady,<br />
whose heart is not prepared<br />
with true teachings,<br />
whose faith is not matured,<br />
the fullness of wisdom is not yet manifest.</p>

<p>39.<br />
There is no fear<br />
if the heart is uncontaminated<br />
by the passions<br />
and the mind is free from ill-will.<br />
Seeing beyond good and evil,<br />
one is awake.</p>

<p>40.<br />
Seeing this body to be as fragile as a clay vessel,<br />
and fortifying the heart like a city wall,<br />
one can confront Mara<br />
with the weapon of insight.<br />
Having the advantage of non-attachment,<br />
one protects what has already been gained.</p>

<p>41.<br />
Certainly this body will soon lie lifeless:<br />
cast aside on the ground,<br />
devoid of consciousness<br />
and as useless as a burnt-out log.</p>

<p>42.<br />
More than a thief,<br />
more than an enemy,<br />
a misdirected heart<br />
brings one to harm.</p>

<p>43.<br />
Neither mother, father<br />
nor any member of a family<br />
can give you the blessings generated<br />
by your own well-directed heart.</p>
