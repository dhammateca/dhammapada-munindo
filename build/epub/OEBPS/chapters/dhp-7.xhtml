<p>90.<br />
There is no tension<br />
for those who have completed their journey<br />
and have become free<br />
from the distress of bondage.</p>

<p>91.<br />
Alert to the needs of the journey,<br />
those on the path of awareness,<br />
like swans, glide on,<br />
leaving behind their former resting places.</p>

<p>92.<br />
Just like birds that leave no tracks in the air,<br />
there are those whose minds do not cling<br />
to temptations that are offered to them.<br />
Their focus is the signless state of liberation,<br />
which to others is indiscernible.</p>

<p>93.<br />
There are those<br />
who are free from all obstructions;<br />
they do not worry about food.<br />
Their focus is the signless state of liberation.<br />
Like birds flying through the air,<br />
trackless they move on their way.</p>

<p>94.<br />
Like horses well-trained by their owners<br />
are those who have rightly tamed their senses;<br />
having freed their hearts<br />
from pride and pollution<br />
they generate all-pervading delight.</p>

<p>95.<br />
There are those who discover<br />
they can completely abandon<br />
confused reactions<br />
and become patient as the earth;<br />
unmoved by anger,<br />
unshaken as a pillar,<br />
unperturbed as a clear and quiet pool.</p>

<p>96.<br />
Those who arrive<br />
at the state of perfect freedom<br />
through right understanding<br />
are unperturbed<br />
in body, speech or mind.<br />
They remain unshaken<br />
by lifeâ€™s vicissitudes.</p>

<p>97.<br />
Those who know the uncreated,<br />
who are free and stilled,<br />
who have discarded all craving,<br />
are the most worthy beings.</p>

<p>98.<br />
Whether in a forest,<br />
a town or open country,<br />
delightful is the dwelling place<br />
of one now fully free.</p>

<p>99.<br />
Beings free from addiction to sensual pleasures<br />
know a unique form of delight.<br />
They seek quiet in forest retreats<br />
which worldly beings would avoid.</p>
