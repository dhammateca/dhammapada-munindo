<h1 id="craving">Craving</h1>

<p>334.<br />
Uncontained craving<br />
grows like a creeper in the forest.<br />
Being lost in it,<br />
one leaps around<br />
like a tree-dwelling ape looking for fruit.</p>

<p>335.<br />
Fostering habits<br />
such as craving and clinging<br />
is like fertilizing noxious weeds.</p>

<p>336.<br />
As water falls from a lotus leaf,<br />
so sorrow drops from those<br />
who are free of toxic craving.</p>

<p>337.<br />
Torrential rains can destroy crops.<br />
Mara can destroy you.<br />
Thus I implore you â€“<br />
dig up the roots of all craving.<br />
I give you my blessing<br />
for this work.</p>

<p>338.<br />
If the roots are not removed,<br />
a tree grows again and again;<br />
suffering returns to us<br />
so long as craving remains.</p>

<p>339.<br />
When the streams<br />
of sensual pleasure run strong<br />
they can generate<br />
a torrent of longing.</p>

<p>340.<br />
The streams of craving flow everywhere.<br />
The wild creeper of craving<br />
spreads and entangles.<br />
Discerning this creeper with insight,<br />
dig it out.</p>

<p>341.<br />
Beings naturally experience pleasure;<br />
but when pleasure is<br />
contaminated with craving,<br />
not releasing it creates frustration<br />
and tedious suffering follows.</p>

<p>342.<br />
Trapped in habits of craving,<br />
people panic<br />
like rabbits caught in a snare.<br />
Their reactions reinforce the pain<br />
of their entrapment.</p>

<p>343.<br />
Trapped in habits of craving,<br />
people panic<br />
like rabbits caught in a snare.<br />
If you wish to be free from entrapment,<br />
craving itself must be removed.</p>

<p>344.<br />
There are those who have begun<br />
on the path to freedom,<br />
yet out of desire return to bondage.</p>

<p>345-346.<br />
Wisdom sees<br />
that being held behind bars<br />
or bound by chains<br />
is less limiting<br />
than infatuation with possessions<br />
and obsession with relationships.<br />
These bonds, though not so obvious,<br />
are strong and hold us down.<br />
To renounce attachment<br />
to the world of the senses<br />
is to be free from the prison of craving.</p>

<p>347.<br />
Like a spider caught in its own web,<br />
a being enwrapped in sensual craving<br />
must be released from its own longings<br />
before it can walk free.</p>

<p>348.<br />
Let go of the past.<br />
Let go of the future.<br />
Let go of the present.<br />
With a heart that is free,<br />
cross over to that shore<br />
which is beyond suffering.</p>

<p>349.<br />
The bonds<br />
of deluded habits and craving<br />
are strengthened<br />
by one who lets the mind heedlessly dwell<br />
on objects of desire.</p>

<p>350.<br />
But one who delights<br />
in calming sensual thoughts,<br />
who is alert<br />
and cultivates awareness<br />
of the loathsome<br />
aspects of the body,<br />
breaks through craving<br />
and unbinds deluded habits.</p>

<p>351.<br />
No more need is there to re-form<br />
for those who have reached the goal;<br />
they are free from fear and longing.<br />
The thorns of existence have been removed.</p>

<p>352.<br />
A master is one who has let go<br />
of all craving and clinging to the world;<br />
who has seen<br />
the truth beyond forms,<br />
yet is possessed of<br />
a profound knowledge of words.<br />
Such a great being can be said<br />
to have finished the task.</p>

<p>353.<br />
I do not declare another as my teacher,<br />
since by myself have I arrived<br />
at the wisdom that overcomes all,<br />
realizes all, renounces all.<br />
Wholly liberated am I from all craving.</p>

<p>354.<br />
The gift of truth excels all gifts.<br />
The flavour of reality<br />
surpasses all flavours.<br />
The delight of truth<br />
transcends all delights.<br />
Freedom from craving<br />
is the end of all suffering.</p>

<p>355.<br />
Riches mostly ruin the foolish,<br />
but not those who seek the beyond.<br />
Just as they dismiss<br />
the well-being of others and cause harm,<br />
fools also ruin themselves.</p>

<p>356.<br />
Weeds cause damage in fields.<br />
Lust causes damage to all beings.<br />
Support those who are free from lust;<br />
the gift will yield great benefit.</p>

<p>357.<br />
Weeds cause damage in fields.<br />
Hatred causes damage to all beings.<br />
Support those who are free from hatred;<br />
the gift will yield great benefit.</p>

<p>358.<br />
Weeds cause damage in fields.<br />
Confusion causes damage to all beings.<br />
Support those who are free from confusion;<br />
the gift will yield great benefit.</p>

<p>359.<br />
Weeds cause damage in fields.<br />
Envy causes damage to all beings.<br />
Encourage those who are free from envy<br />
and there will be great benefit.</p>
