<h1 id="the-buddha">The Buddha</h1>

<p>179.<br />
The Buddha’s perfection is complete;<br />
there is no more work to be done.<br />
No measure is there for his wisdom;<br />
no limits are there to be found.<br />
In what way could he be distracted<br />
from truth?</p>

<p>180.<br />
The Buddha’s perfection is complete;<br />
in him there is no craving<br />
that could drag him down.<br />
No measure is there for his wisdom;<br />
no limits are there to be found.<br />
In what way could he be distracted<br />
from truth?</p>

<p>181.<br />
Celestial beings treasure<br />
the Awakened Ones<br />
who have fully seen the Way,<br />
who are devoted to meditation<br />
and delight in the peace<br />
of renunciation.</p>

<p>182.<br />
It is not easy to be born as a human being<br />
and to live this mortal life.<br />
It is not easy to have the opportunity<br />
to hear Dhamma<br />
and rare for a Buddha to arise.</p>

<p>183.<br />
Refrain from doing evil,<br />
cultivate that which is good,<br />
purify the heart.<br />
This is the Way of the Awakened Ones.</p>

<p>184.<br />
A renunciate does not<br />
oppress anyone.<br />
Patient endurance<br />
is the ultimate asceticism.<br />
Profound liberation,<br />
say the Buddhas,<br />
is the supreme goal.</p>

<p>185.<br />
Not insulting, not harming,<br />
cultivating restraint,<br />
with respect for the training,<br />
modesty in eating and contentment<br />
with one’s dwelling place,<br />
devotion to mindful intent:<br />
this is the teaching of the Buddha.</p>

<p>186-187.<br />
Not in great wealth<br />
is there contentment,<br />
nor in sensual pleasure,<br />
gross or refined.<br />
But in the extinction of craving<br />
is joy to be found<br />
by a disciple of the Buddha.</p>

<p>188-189.<br />
To many places beings withdraw<br />
to escape from fear:<br />
to mountains, forests,<br />
parklands and gardens;<br />
sacred places as well.<br />
But none of these places<br />
offer true refuge,<br />
none of them can free us from fear.</p>

<p>190-191.<br />
One who finds refuge in the Buddha<br />
in the Dhamma and in the Sangha<br />
sees with penetrating insight<br />
suffering, its cause, its release<br />
and the Way leading to true freedom.</p>

<p>192.<br />
The Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha:<br />
these are the true refuge;<br />
these are supreme;<br />
these lead to Liberation.</p>

<p>193.<br />
It is hard to find<br />
a being of great wisdom;<br />
rare are the places<br />
in which they are born.<br />
Those who surround them<br />
when they appear<br />
know good fortune indeed.</p>

<p>194.<br />
Blessed is the arising of a Buddha;<br />
blessed is the revealing of the Dhamma;<br />
blessed is the concord of the Sangha;<br />
delightful is harmonious communion.</p>

<p>195-196.<br />
Immeasurable is the benefit<br />
obtained from honouring those<br />
who are pure and beyond fear.<br />
Beings who have found freedom<br />
from sorrow and grieving<br />
are worthy of honour.</p>
