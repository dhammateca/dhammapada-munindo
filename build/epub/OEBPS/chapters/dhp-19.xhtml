<p>256.<br />
Making an arbitrary decision<br />
does not amount to justice.<br />
The wise decide the case<br />
after considered arguments<br />
for and against.</p>

<p>257.<br />
By making decisions<br />
based on truth and fairness<br />
one safeguards the law<br />
and is called righteous.</p>

<p>258.<br />
Those who speak much<br />
are not necessarily possessed of wisdom.<br />
The wise can be seen<br />
to be at peace with life<br />
and free from all enmity and fear.</p>

<p>259.<br />
Though oneâ€™s knowledge<br />
may be limited,<br />
if understanding and conduct<br />
rightly accord with the Way,<br />
one is to be considered<br />
well-versed in Dhamma.</p>

<p>260.<br />
Having grey hair<br />
does not make you an elder;<br />
ripe in years maybe,<br />
but perhaps pointlessly so.</p>

<p>261.<br />
One who is truthful,<br />
virtuous, impeccable in conduct,<br />
free from all stains and wise<br />
can be called an elder.</p>

<p>262 -263.<br />
Those who are envious,<br />
stingy and manipulative<br />
remain unappealing despite<br />
good looks and eloquent speech.<br />
But those who have freed themselves<br />
from their faults<br />
and arrived at wisdom<br />
are attractive indeed.</p>

<p>264.<br />
Shaving your head<br />
does not make you a renunciate<br />
if you are still full of<br />
recklessness and deceit.<br />
How could someone possessed<br />
by craving and lust<br />
be considered a renunciate?</p>

<p>265.<br />
You become a monk or nun<br />
by letting go of all evil,<br />
by renouncing all<br />
unwholesomeness,<br />
both great and small.</p>

<p>266.<br />
You are not a monk or nun<br />
because you depend<br />
on others for food,<br />
but by submitting yourself<br />
wholeheartedly<br />
to the training of body,<br />
speech and mind.</p>

<p>267.<br />
You become a monk or nun<br />
by seeing through this world<br />
with understanding,<br />
by rising above good and bad<br />
and living a life of purity<br />
and contemplation.</p>

<p>268-269.<br />
Silence does not denote profundity<br />
if you are ignorant and untrained.<br />
Like one holding scales<br />
a sage weighs things up,<br />
wholesome and unwholesome,<br />
and comes to know<br />
both the inner and outer worlds.<br />
Therefore the sage is called wise.</p>

<p>270.<br />
Those who still cause harm<br />
to living beings<br />
cannot be considered as attained.<br />
Those who are attained<br />
maintain a harmless demeanour<br />
towards all beings.</p>

<p>271-272.<br />
Do not rest contented<br />
because you keep all the rules and regulations,<br />
nor because you achieve great learning.<br />
Do not feel satisfied because you<br />
attain meditative absorption,<br />
nor because you can dwell in<br />
the bliss of solitude.<br />
Only when you arrive<br />
at the complete eradication<br />
of all ignorance and conceit<br />
should you be content.</p>
