<h1 id="the-elephant">The Elephant</h1>

<p>320.<br />
As an elephant in battle<br />
withstands arrows,<br />
I choose to endure<br />
verbal attacks from others.</p>

<p>321.<br />
Well-trained horses<br />
can be trusted in crowds,<br />
and are to be mounted by kings.<br />
Individuals who have trained<br />
themselves to withstand abuse<br />
will be valuable everywhere.</p>

<p>322.<br />
Impressive are horses or elephants<br />
which have been well-trained;<br />
but more impressive<br />
are individuals<br />
who have tamed themselves.</p>

<p>323.<br />
It is not on a well-trained animal<br />
that you can ride<br />
to the land of liberation;<br />
it is only on the vehicle<br />
of a well-trained self<br />
that you will arrive there.</p>

<p>324.<br />
When captured and bound and in rut,<br />
a wild elephant is restless, uncontrollable,<br />
not eating its food.<br />
It longs for its native forest home.</p>

<p>325.<br />
It is a fool who overeats<br />
and indulges in laziness,<br />
then, feeling drowsy,<br />
wallows in sleep like an oversized pig;<br />
this forebodes perpetual suffering.</p>

<p>326.<br />
My mind which was once<br />
wild and unruly,<br />
wandering as it wished,<br />
I hold now in check<br />
as the mahout with his hook<br />
controls an elephant in rut.</p>

<p>327.<br />
As an elephant<br />
resolutely drags itself from a swamp,<br />
uplift yourself with the inspiration<br />
of cultivated attention.</p>

<p>328.<br />
If you find a good companion,<br />
of integrity and wisdom,<br />
you will overcome all dangers<br />
in joyous and caring company.</p>

<p>329.<br />
But if you cannot find<br />
a good companion<br />
of integrity and wisdom,<br />
then, like a king departing<br />
a conquered land,<br />
or an elephant wandering<br />
alone in the forest,<br />
walk alone.</p>

<p>330.<br />
A harmless solitary life<br />
lived at ease,<br />
like that of the lone elephant in the forest,<br />
is better than<br />
the unnecessary company of fools.</p>

<p>331.<br />
The timely company of friends is goodness.<br />
Fewness of needs is goodness.<br />
Having accumulated virtue<br />
at life’s end is goodness.<br />
Having dispensed<br />
with all suffering is goodness.</p>

<p>332.<br />
Rightly serving one’s parents is goodness.<br />
Supporting renunciates is goodness.<br />
Honouring awakened beings is goodness.</p>

<p>333.<br />
Sustaining virtue into old age is goodness.<br />
Sustaining sound faith is goodness.<br />
The arising of insight is goodness.<br />
Renouncing evil is goodness.</p>
