<p>167.<br />
By renouncing unworthy ways<br />
and by not living carelessly,<br />
by not holding to false views,<br />
we no longer perpetuate delusion.</p>

<p>168.<br />
Do not show false humility.<br />
Stand firmly in relation to your goal.<br />
Practice, well-observed,<br />
leads to contentment<br />
both now and in the future.</p>

<p>169.<br />
Live your life well in accord with the Way –<br />
avoid a life of distraction.<br />
A life well-lived leads to contentment<br />
both now and in the future.</p>

<p>170.<br />
The King of Death cannot find<br />
those who look upon the world<br />
as insubstantial,<br />
as transient, a bubble –<br />
illusive, only a mirage.</p>

<p>171.<br />
Come, view this world.<br />
See it as an ornate festive carriage.<br />
See how fools are entranced by their visions,<br />
yet for the wise there is no attachment.</p>

<p>172.<br />
There are those<br />
who awaken from heedlessness.<br />
They bring light into the world<br />
like the moon<br />
emerging from clouds.</p>

<p>173.<br />
One who transforms old and heedless ways<br />
into fresh and wholesome acts<br />
brings light into the world<br />
like the moon freed from clouds.</p>

<p>174.<br />
If birds are trapped in a net<br />
only a few will ever escape.<br />
In this world of illusion<br />
only a few see their way to liberation.</p>

<p>175.<br />
White swans rise into the air.<br />
Adept yogis<br />
transport themselves through space.<br />
Wise beings<br />
transcend worldly delusion<br />
by outwitting the hordes of Mara.</p>

<p>176.<br />
For one who transgresses<br />
the law of truthfulness,<br />
one who has no regard<br />
for a future existence,<br />
there is no manner of evil<br />
that is impossible.</p>

<p>177.<br />
Those who fail to value generosity<br />
do not reach the celestial realms.<br />
But the wise rejoice in giving<br />
and forever abide in bliss.</p>

<p>178.<br />
Better than ruling the whole world,<br />
better than going to heaven,<br />
better than lordship over the universe,<br />
is an irreversible commitment to the Way.</p>
