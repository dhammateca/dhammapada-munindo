<h1 id="great-being">Great Being</h1>

<p>383.<br />
Diligently cut off<br />
the stream of craving<br />
and abandon sensual longings;<br />
knowing the inherent limitations<br />
of all that is formed,<br />
realize the uncreated.</p>

<p>384.<br />
All chains of confinement fall away<br />
from those who see clearly<br />
beyond the two.</p>

<p>385.<br />
I say a being is great<br />
who stands not on this shore,<br />
nor the other shore,<br />
nor on any shore at all.<br />
Such a being is free from all ties.</p>

<p>386.<br />
I say a being is great<br />
who dwells secluded and at ease,<br />
knowing the heart<br />
free from all pollution,<br />
having completed the task,<br />
purified of all compulsive tendencies<br />
and awake.</p>

<p>387.<br />
The sun shines by day,<br />
the moon shines by night.<br />
But both all day and all night<br />
the Buddha shines<br />
in glorious splendour.</p>

<p>388.<br />
Having transformed evil,<br />
one is called a great being.<br />
Living peacefully,<br />
one is called a contemplative.<br />
Having given up impurity,<br />
one is called a renunciate.</p>

<p>389.<br />
Non-retaliation<br />
is the characteristic of great beings.<br />
They do not give rise to anger.<br />
Should they be attacked,<br />
it is not in their nature to strike back.</p>

<p>390.<br />
Suffering subsides to the degree<br />
that you are free from the intention<br />
to cause harm.<br />
There is no real greatness<br />
if there is no restraint of anger.</p>

<p>391.<br />
One who refrains from causing harm<br />
by way of body, speech or mind,<br />
can be called a worthy being.</p>

<p>392.<br />
Devotion and respect<br />
should be offered to those<br />
who have shown us the Way.</p>

<p>393.<br />
One should not be considered<br />
worthy of respect<br />
because of birth or background,<br />
or any outer sign;<br />
it is purity<br />
and the realization of truth<br />
that determine one’s worth.</p>

<p>394.<br />
Your outer adornments<br />
and pseudo-spiritual preoccupations<br />
are irrelevant<br />
if inwardly you remain in disarray.</p>

<p>395.<br />
To be unconcerned<br />
about outer appearance<br />
but committed to<br />
intense relentless practice<br />
makes for greatness.</p>

<p>396.<br />
No one is noble<br />
merely because of what they inherit.<br />
Nobility comes from cleansing oneself<br />
of all pollutions<br />
and attachments.</p>

<p>397.<br />
Whoever has cut all that tethers<br />
and found fearlessness,<br />
who is beyond attachments<br />
and defilements,<br />
I recognize as a great being.</p>

<p>398.<br />
Whoever severs the ties of hatred,<br />
unbinds the ropes of craving,<br />
undoes the locks of wrong view,<br />
opens the doors of ignorance<br />
and sees truth,<br />
I recognize as a great being.</p>

<p>399.<br />
Strength of patience<br />
is the might of noble beings;<br />
they can be shackled,<br />
endure verbal abuse and beatings,<br />
without resorting to anger.</p>

<p>400.<br />
Those who are free from anger,<br />
simply disciplined, virtuous,<br />
well-trained<br />
and have gone beyond rebirth,<br />
these I call great beings.</p>

<p>401.<br />
As water slides from a lotus leaf,<br />
so sensual pleasures<br />
do not cling<br />
to a great being.</p>

<p>402.<br />
Those who know the freedom<br />
of having laid aside<br />
the burden of attachment<br />
to the body-mind<br />
I call great beings.</p>

<p>403.<br />
Those possessed of deep wisdom,<br />
who see what accords with the Way<br />
and what does not,<br />
those who have attained<br />
to the peak of possibility,<br />
I call great beings.</p>

<p>404.<br />
Those who are free from attachment<br />
to the company of either householders<br />
or fellow renunciates,<br />
and so wander free from desires<br />
or concern for security of any kind,<br />
are great beings.</p>

<p>405.<br />
Those who have renounced<br />
the use of force<br />
in relationship to other beings,<br />
whether weak or strong,<br />
who neither kill<br />
nor cause to be killed,<br />
can be called great beings.</p>

<p>406.<br />
Those who remain<br />
friendly amid the hostile,<br />
at peace among the aggressive,<br />
and who do not attach themselves<br />
to that upon which others depend<br />
are great beings.</p>

<p>407.<br />
For a great being,<br />
lust and ill-will,<br />
arrogance and conceit<br />
drop away,<br />
even as a tiny seed would drop<br />
from the tip of a needle.</p>

<p>408.<br />
Those who speak truth<br />
and give gentle encouragement,<br />
contending with no-one,<br />
these do I call great beings.</p>

<p>409.<br />
The actions of a great being are pure.<br />
Great beings never<br />
knowingly take for themselves<br />
that which belongs to another.</p>

<p>410.<br />
The heart of a great being is free.<br />
Great beings no longer pine<br />
for things of this world<br />
or any other world.</p>

<p>411.<br />
The heart of a great being is free.<br />
With accurate understanding<br />
which is beyond doubt,<br />
great beings have set their feet firmly<br />
in the land of liberation.</p>

<p>412.<br />
Whoever has transcended<br />
all ties of good and bad,<br />
is purified<br />
and free from sorrow,<br />
should be called a great being.</p>

<p>413.<br />
Those beings who<br />
are released from all longing<br />
and, like the moon in a cloudless sky,<br />
are pure, clear and serene,<br />
I call great.</p>

<p>414.<br />
There are beings<br />
who travel the difficult path<br />
across the dangerous swamp<br />
of defiling passions,<br />
traverse the ocean of delusion,<br />
through the darkness of ignorance,<br />
and go beyond.<br />
They are sustained<br />
by wise contemplation,<br />
secure in freedom from doubt,<br />
liberated;<br />
such beings are great indeed.</p>

<p>415.<br />
It is a great being<br />
who, having restrained desires<br />
for sensual pleasure,<br />
lives the homeless life<br />
and realizes freedom<br />
from both sensual desire<br />
and perpetual becoming.</p>

<p>416.<br />
It is a great being<br />
who, having restrained all craving,<br />
lives the homeless life<br />
and realizes freedom<br />
from both craving<br />
and perpetual becoming.</p>

<p>417.<br />
It is a great being<br />
who can see through all obvious delights<br />
as well as subtle pleasures,<br />
to be free from attachment.</p>

<p>418.<br />
Those who cease<br />
setting up like against dislike,<br />
who are cooled,<br />
who are not swayed<br />
by worldly conditions –<br />
these I call great beings.</p>

<p>419.<br />
I say anyone who understands fully<br />
the passing away and arising of beings,<br />
who remains aware,<br />
non-attached, awake,<br />
who is conscious of<br />
right action at all times,<br />
is a great being.</p>

<p>420.<br />
The condition after death<br />
of great beings is indiscernible;<br />
no trace of passion remains.<br />
They are pure.</p>

<p>421.<br />
Anyone who lives freed<br />
from habits of clinging<br />
to past, present or future,<br />
attaching to nothing,<br />
is a great being.</p>

<p>422.<br />
A great being is fearless like a bull,<br />
noble, strong, wise, diligent,<br />
sees through delusions,<br />
is clear, attentive and awake.</p>

<p>423.<br />
To understand all dimensions<br />
of past existence,<br />
to see accurately into all realms,<br />
to reach the end of rebirths,<br />
to know with insight<br />
that which must be known,<br />
to free the heart from ignorance –<br />
this is truly being made great.</p>
