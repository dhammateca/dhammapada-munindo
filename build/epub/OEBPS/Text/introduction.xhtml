<p>The book you hold is a sparkling basket of light, full of illumination
of the human situation. It is a version of the Buddhist classic, the
Dhammapada; not a line-by-line translation but a free rendering that
aims to communicate the living spirit of the text, unencumbered by rigid
adherence to formal exactness. The intention of the author, Ajahn
Munindo, was to present a contemporary version of the text for readers
to use in their investigation of the Way. Hence its title is <em>A
Dhammapada for Contemplation</em>, indicating that the work is not to be
considered as a definitive translation, but as an invitation to
encounter and to contemplate the Buddha’s wisdom.</p>

<p>It is a life of contemplation that is the context for this rendering.
Ajahn Munindo, who was born in New Zealand, was ordained as a bhikkhu or
monk of the Theravadan tradition in Thailand twenty-five years ago. He
now resides in a small spiritual community in Northumberland, England,
where he lives under a code of discipline going back to the Buddha,
which encourages simplicity and right attention. Transplanting this
Buddhist monastic way of life from the eastern countries where Buddhism
has been long established into the West has meant a process of
translation involving language, practices and rituals, such that the
Theravadan tradition, along with others, is now established within the
Western cultural ambience. <em>A Dhammapada for Contemplation</em>, therefore,
although a free rendering by scholarly standards, aims to communicate a
precise translation of values — the spiritual values of the living
Buddhist tradition.</p>
