<h1 id="the-thousands">The Thousands</h1>

<p>100.<br />
A single word of truth<br />
which calms the mind<br />
is better to hear than a thousand<br />
irrelevant words.</p>

<p>101.<br />
A single verse of truth<br />
which calms the mind<br />
is better to hear than a thousand<br />
irrelevant verses.</p>

<p>102.<br />
Reciting a single verse of truth<br />
which calms the mind<br />
is better than reciting<br />
a hundred meaningless verses.</p>

<p>103.<br />
One might defeat alone in battle<br />
a thousand thousand men,<br />
but one who gains self-mastery<br />
is by far the greater hero.</p>

<p>104-105.<br />
Self-mastery is the supreme victory â€“<br />
much more to be valued<br />
than winning control over others.<br />
It is a victory<br />
that no other being whatsoever<br />
can distort or take away.</p>

<p>106.<br />
To honour, even for a single moment,<br />
one who has attained self-mastery<br />
is of greater merit<br />
than making countless offerings<br />
to those who are unworthy.</p>

<p>107.<br />
To honour, even for a single moment,<br />
one who has attained self-mastery<br />
is of greater benefit than a hundred years<br />
spent habitually performing ceremonies<br />
based on wrong understanding.</p>

<p>108.<br />
Even if one should spend<br />
an entire year<br />
making gestures of offering<br />
for the sake of self-gain,<br />
all this is not worth one quarter the value<br />
of offering veneration to a noble being.</p>

<p>109.<br />
For one who always honours and respects<br />
those of greater years<br />
there are four blessings:<br />
long life, beauty, happiness and strength.</p>

<p>110.<br />
A single day lived<br />
with conscious intention and virtue<br />
is of greater value than a hundred years<br />
lived devoid of discipline and right restraint.</p>

<p>111.<br />
A single day lived<br />
with conscious intention and wisdom<br />
is of greater value than a hundred years<br />
lived devoid of discipline and wisdom.</p>

<p>112.<br />
A single day lived<br />
with conscious intention and profound effort<br />
is of greater value than a hundred years<br />
lived in lazy passivity.</p>

<p>113.<br />
A single day lived in awareness<br />
of the transient nature of life<br />
is of greater value than a hundred years<br />
lived unaware of birth and death.</p>

<p>114.<br />
A single day lived awake to the undying state<br />
is of greater value than a hundred years<br />
lived without recognizing deathlessness.</p>

<p>115.<br />
A single day lived awake to profound truth<br />
is of greater value than a hundred years<br />
lived unawakened.</p>
