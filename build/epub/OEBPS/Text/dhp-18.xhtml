<h1 id="pollution">Pollution</h1>

<p>235.<br />
Resembling a withered leaf,<br />
you have the messenger<br />
of death at your side.<br />
Although a long journey lies ahead,<br />
you have still made no provision.</p>

<p>236.<br />
Hasten to cultivate wisdom;<br />
make an island for yourself.<br />
Freed from stain and defilement,<br />
you will enter noble being.</p>

<p>237.<br />
It is time for you to come<br />
into the presence of the Lord of Death.<br />
There is no time for rest on this journey,<br />
yet what provision have you made?</p>

<p>238.<br />
Hasten to cultivate wisdom;<br />
make an island for yourself.<br />
Freed from stain and defilement,<br />
you are released from birth and death.</p>

<p>239.<br />
Gradually, gradually,<br />
a moment at a time,<br />
the wise remove their own impurities<br />
as a goldsmith removes the dross.</p>

<p>240.<br />
As iron is destroyed by the rust it produces,<br />
so those who perform evil are corroded<br />
by their own action.</p>

<p>241.<br />
Lack of study leads<br />
to forgetting the teachings;<br />
neglect spoils the home;<br />
laziness leads to loss of beauty;<br />
heedlessness ruins attention.</p>

<p>242.<br />
Sexual misconduct<br />
diminishes those who perform it;<br />
stinginess diminishes<br />
those who could give.<br />
Acts that diminish their doer<br />
are stains indeed.</p>

<p>243.<br />
But the worst stain of all<br />
is ignorance.<br />
Be purified of this<br />
and you are free.</p>

<p>244.<br />
Life is apparently easy<br />
for one who lacks shame,<br />
who is as impudent as a crow,<br />
who is arrogant, aggressive,<br />
intrusive and corrupt.</p>

<p>245.<br />
Life is not easy for those<br />
who have a sense of shame,<br />
who are modest,<br />
pure-minded and detached,<br />
morally upright and reflective.</p>

<p>246-247.<br />
Whoever destroys life,<br />
disregards truth,<br />
is sexually irresponsible,<br />
takes what is not rightfully theirs,<br />
and heedlessly indulges in drugs<br />
destroys the very roots<br />
of their own life.</p>

<p>248.<br />
Whoever is intent on goodness<br />
should know this:<br />
a lack of self-restraint is disastrous.<br />
Do not allow greed and misconduct<br />
to prolong your misery.</p>

<p>249-250.<br />
People are inspired to be generous<br />
according to their faith and trust.<br />
If we become discontented<br />
with what we have been given,<br />
our meditation will be filled<br />
with endless mental affliction;<br />
but if we are free from this discontent,<br />
our meditation is full of peace.</p>

<p>251.<br />
There is no fire like lust,<br />
no obstruction like hatred,<br />
no trap like delusion,<br />
and no vortex like craving.</p>

<p>252.<br />
It is easy to see the faults of others,<br />
but it takes courage to look at one’s own.<br />
As with chaff,<br />
one might winnow others’ shortcomings<br />
while hiding one’s own;<br />
as a stealthy hunter<br />
might conceal himself from his prey.</p>

<p>253.<br />
Those who always look for<br />
the faults of others –<br />
their corruptions increase<br />
and they are far from freedom.</p>

<p>254.<br />
No tracks are found in the air,<br />
there is no liberation apart from the Way.<br />
Most people tend to indulge in proliferation,<br />
from which Awakened Ones are free.</p>

<p>255.<br />
No tracks are found in the air,<br />
there is no liberation apart from the Way.<br />
There are no conditioned things<br />
that are permanent,<br />
and yet the Buddhas remain unperturbed.</p>
