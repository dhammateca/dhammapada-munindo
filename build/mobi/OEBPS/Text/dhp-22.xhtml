<h1 id="hell">Hell</h1>

<p>306.<br />
Lying leads to sorrow.<br />
Concealing wrong actions<br />
leads to sorrow.<br />
These two acts of deceit<br />
take beings<br />
to the same state of woe.</p>

<p>307.<br />
Those who wear<br />
the robes of a renunciate,<br />
yet harbour evil<br />
and are unrestrained,<br />
go to a sorrowful state.</p>

<p>308.<br />
It would be better for a renunciate<br />
to swallow molten iron<br />
than to live on offerings<br />
deceitfully gained.</p>

<p>309.<br />
Accumulated sadness,<br />
troubled sleep,<br />
blame and remorse<br />
are an adultererâ€™s lot.</p>

<p>310.<br />
Brief is the delight<br />
of the fearful adulterous couple,<br />
for only painful consequences can follow.</p>

<p>311.<br />
As <em>kusa</em> grass wrongly grasped<br />
wounds the hand that holds it,<br />
so the renunciate life<br />
hurts those who train in it wrongly.</p>

<p>312.<br />
Acts carelessly done,<br />
practices corruptly performed,<br />
the holy life lived perversely,<br />
lead to little or no benefit at all.</p>

<p>313.<br />
If anything is to be done,<br />
do it well,<br />
with energy and devotion;<br />
the renunciate life led heedlessly<br />
just stirs up the dust.</p>

<p>314.<br />
Hurtful deeds<br />
are better left undone<br />
as they always lead to remorse.<br />
Harmless deeds are better done<br />
as no regret will follow.</p>

<p>315.<br />
As a border city must be carefully protected,<br />
so guard yourself both within and without;<br />
build your defences wisely and in time.<br />
If these things are not attended to<br />
at the right moment,<br />
great sadness will come.</p>

<p>316.<br />
Distorted views<br />
which create feelings of shame<br />
about that which is not shameful,<br />
or indifference<br />
to that which is shameful,<br />
can cause beings to descend into hell.</p>

<p>317.<br />
Distorted views<br />
which create feelings of fear<br />
towards what is not actually threatening,<br />
or indifference in the face<br />
of that which is threatening,<br />
can cause beings to descend into hell.</p>

<p>318.<br />
Distorted views,<br />
which give rise to seeing right as wrong<br />
and wrong as right<br />
cause beings to disintegrate.</p>

<p>319.<br />
The clear seeing which knows<br />
that which is flawed as flawed<br />
and that which is pure as pure<br />
can lead beings to transcend misery.</p>
