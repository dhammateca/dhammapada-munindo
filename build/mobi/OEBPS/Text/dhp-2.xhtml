<h1 id="awareness">Awareness</h1>

<p>21.<br />
Appreciative awareness leads to life;<br />
heedless avoidance is the path to death.<br />
Those who are aware are fully alive,<br />
while those who are heedless<br />
are as if already dead.</p>

<p>22.<br />
The wise, being fully alive, rejoice<br />
in appreciative awareness,<br />
and abide delighting<br />
in this ability.</p>

<p>23.<br />
The Awakened Ones, firm in their resolve,<br />
vigorously apply themselves,<br />
and know freedom from all limitation:<br />
liberation, true security.</p>

<p>24.<br />
Those who are energetically<br />
committed to the Way,<br />
who are pure and considerate in effort,<br />
composed and virtuous in conduct,<br />
steadily increase in radiance.</p>

<p>25.<br />
By endeavour, vigilance,<br />
restraint and self-control,<br />
let the wise make islands of themselves<br />
which no flood can overwhelm.</p>

<p>26.<br />
Those who are foolish and confused<br />
betray themselves to heedlessness.<br />
The wise treasure the awareness<br />
they have cultivated<br />
as their most precious possession.</p>

<p>27.<br />
“Do not become lost in negligence,<br />
do not become lost in sensuality.”<br />
Heeding such counsel,<br />
the contemplative discovers<br />
profound release.</p>

<p>28.<br />
Those Awakened Ones<br />
who have tasted freedom<br />
from all distraction<br />
by cultivating awareness<br />
view all who are suffering<br />
with compassionate perspective,<br />
as one on a mountain top<br />
is able to view the plains.</p>

<p>29.<br />
Aware among those who are heedless,<br />
awake among those who sleep,<br />
the wise go forward like strong young horses,<br />
leaving the exhausted behind.</p>

<p>30.<br />
By way of diligent awareness<br />
the god Magha won his realm.<br />
Diligence is ever rewarded,<br />
negligence is ever scorned.</p>

<p>31.<br />
The renunciate who delights in vigilance<br />
and shuns heedlessness<br />
advances like a grass fire,<br />
consuming obstructions great and small.</p>

<p>32.<br />
The renunciate who delights in vigilance<br />
and shuns heedlessness<br />
is protected from regression:<br />
such a one approaches liberation.</p>
