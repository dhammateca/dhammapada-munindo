<p>209.<br />
There are those who pursue<br />
that which should be avoided<br />
and avoid that which<br />
should be pursued.<br />
Caught up in the senses<br />
they lose their way,<br />
and later envy<br />
those who know the truth.</p>

<p>210.<br />
To lose the company<br />
of those with whom<br />
one feels at home is painful,<br />
to be associated with those<br />
whom you dislike is even worse;<br />
so do not abandon yourselves<br />
either to the company of those<br />
with whom you feel at home<br />
or those whom you dislike.</p>

<p>211.<br />
Beware of the attachment<br />
that springs from fondness,<br />
for separation from those<br />
one holds dear is painful,<br />
while if you take sides<br />
neither for nor against fondness,<br />
there will be no ties that bind.</p>

<p>212.<br />
From endearment springs grief.<br />
From endearment springs fear of loss.<br />
Yet, if one is free from endearment<br />
there is no grief<br />
so how could there be fear?</p>

<p>213.<br />
Becoming lost in affection<br />
brings sorrow;<br />
becoming lost in affection<br />
brings fear.<br />
Being free from affection<br />
means sorrow ceases,<br />
so how could there be any fear?</p>

<p>214.<br />
Becoming lost in enjoyment<br />
brings sorrow;<br />
becoming lost in enjoyment<br />
brings fear.<br />
Being free in your experience of enjoyment<br />
means sorrow ceases,<br />
so how could there be any fear?</p>

<p>215.<br />
Becoming lost in lust<br />
brings sorrow;<br />
becoming lost in lust<br />
brings fear.<br />
Not being lost in lust<br />
means sorrow ceases,<br />
so how could there be any fear?</p>

<p>216.<br />
Becoming lost in craving<br />
brings sorrow;<br />
becoming lost in craving<br />
brings fear.<br />
Being free from craving<br />
means sorrow ceases,<br />
so how could there be any fear?</p>

<p>217.<br />
Naturally held dear are those<br />
who live with right action<br />
and have found the Way,<br />
and through insight<br />
have become established in the truth.</p>

<p>218.<br />
Those who long<br />
for the undefinable,<br />
with hearts filled with inspiration,<br />
whose minds are freed<br />
from sensual longing,<br />
are called<br />
“those bound for freedom”.</p>

<p>219-220.<br />
Just as family and friends<br />
joyfully welcome home<br />
loved ones returned from afar,<br />
so their own good deeds<br />
welcome those who have done them<br />
as they go from this life to the next.</p>
