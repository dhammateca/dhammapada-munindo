<p>290.<br />
It is wisdom<br />
that enables letting go<br />
of a lesser happiness<br />
in pursuit of a happiness<br />
which is greater.</p>

<p>291.<br />
You fail<br />
in the pursuit of happiness<br />
if it is at the expense<br />
of others’ well-being.<br />
The snare of ill-will<br />
can still entangle you.</p>

<p>292.<br />
To leave undone<br />
that which should be done<br />
and to do that<br />
which should be avoided<br />
leads to carelessness and conceit.<br />
It will increase confusion.</p>

<p>293.<br />
Confusion ceases<br />
by maintaining<br />
a meditation practice<br />
focused in the body,<br />
by avoiding that<br />
which should not be done<br />
and by mindfully doing<br />
that which should be done.</p>

<p>294.<br />
By removing craving and conceit,<br />
eradicating wrong views,<br />
and overcoming<br />
the deluded attachments of the sense realm,<br />
the noble being moves freely on.</p>

<p>295.<br />
Having cleared<br />
all the hindrances to the Path –<br />
greed, rage, dullness and laziness,<br />
worry, anxiety and doubt –<br />
the noble being freely moves on.</p>

<p>296.<br />
Disciples of the Buddha<br />
are fully awake,<br />
dwelling both day and night<br />
in contemplation of the Awakened One.</p>

<p>297.<br />
Disciples of the Buddha<br />
are fully awake,<br />
dwelling both day and night<br />
in contemplation of reality.</p>

<p>298.<br />
Disciples of the Buddha<br />
are fully awake,<br />
dwelling both day and night<br />
in contemplation of the communion<br />
of beings who have awakened.</p>

<p>299.<br />
Disciples of the Buddha<br />
are fully awake,<br />
dwelling both day and night<br />
in contemplation of<br />
the true nature of the body.</p>

<p>300.<br />
Disciples of the Buddha<br />
are fully awake<br />
both day and night,<br />
taking delight in compassion.</p>

<p>301.<br />
Disciples of the Buddha<br />
are fully awake<br />
both day and night,<br />
taking delight<br />
in cultivating the heart.</p>

<p>302.<br />
It is hard to live<br />
the life of renunciation;<br />
its challenges<br />
are difficult to find pleasant.<br />
Yet it is also hard to live<br />
the householder’s life;<br />
there is pain<br />
when associating with those<br />
among whom one feels no companionship.<br />
To wander uncommitted<br />
is always going to be difficult;<br />
why not renounce<br />
the deluded pursuit of pain?</p>

<p>303.<br />
A traveller possessed of virtue,<br />
disciplined and committed to right conduct,<br />
will be received with honour;<br />
such a one can be recognized<br />
and can travel with confidence.</p>

<p>304.<br />
The good<br />
are seen even from afar.<br />
They shine like the distant<br />
Himalayan peaks.<br />
The untrained simply disappear<br />
like arrows shot into the dark.</p>

<p>305.<br />
With enthusiasm establish yourself<br />
in solitary practice –<br />
sit alone, sleep alone, walk alone<br />
and delight as if secluded in the forest.</p>
