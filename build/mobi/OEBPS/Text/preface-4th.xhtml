<p><em>To the fourth edition (2015)</em></p>

<p>We continue to receive requests for copies of this <em>Dhammapada for
Contemplation</em> and are grateful to our good friends in Malaysia for
making a reprint possible.</p>

<p>As well as using resources mentioned above in earlier editions, in adjusting
some verses I have had the benefit of translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and
Acharya Buddharakkhita (see
<a href="http://accesstoinsight.org">www.accesstoinsight.org</a>).</p>

<p>For those who are interested, these are the verses I have significantly
reworked: 1, 2, 36, 78, 95, 123, 141, 183, 198, 223, 231, 232, 233, 244, 331,
332, 333, 383, 384,421. Otherwise, the text of this rendering of the Dhammapada
remains mostly the same as previous editions.</p>

<p>As before, I encourage readers to refer to other versions of the Dhammapada,
particularly those mentioned as resources for this book.</p>
