<h1 id="the-foolish">The Foolish</h1>

<p>60.<br />
The night is long<br />
for one who cannot sleep.<br />
A journey is long for one who is tired.<br />
Ignorant existence is long and tedious<br />
for those unaware of Truth.</p>

<p>61.<br />
Having found no companion<br />
who has travelled at least as far as ourselves,<br />
it is better to go alone<br />
than to accompany those<br />
who remain irresolute.</p>

<p>62.<br />
“This is my child, this is my wealth”:<br />
such thoughts are the preoccupations of fools.<br />
If we are unable to own even ourselves,<br />
why make such claims?</p>

<p>63.<br />
The fool who knows he is a fool<br />
is at least a little wise;<br />
the fool who thinks that he is wise<br />
is assuredly a fool.</p>

<p>64.<br />
Like spoons unable to taste<br />
the flavour of the soup<br />
are the fools who cannot see truth,<br />
even though they live<br />
all their lives among the wise.</p>

<p>65.<br />
Like the tongue that can appreciate<br />
the flavour of the soup<br />
is one who can clearly discern the truth<br />
after only a brief<br />
association with the wise.</p>

<p>66.<br />
By heedlessly performing evil,<br />
unwary fools produce their own bitter fruits.<br />
They behave like their worst enemy.</p>

<p>67.<br />
A deed is not well-done<br />
when upon reflection remorse arises:<br />
with tears of sorrow<br />
one harvests its fruit.</p>

<p>68.<br />
A deed is well-done<br />
when upon reflection no remorse arises:<br />
with joy one harvests its fruits.</p>

<p>69.<br />
Fools perceive evil acts<br />
to be sweet as honey<br />
until they have seen the consequences.<br />
When they behold their fruits,<br />
fools suffer indeed.</p>

<p>70.<br />
Even after months of rigid asceticism,<br />
subsisting on a frugal diet,<br />
a fool is not to be compared in value<br />
to the person who simply sees the truth.</p>

<p>71.<br />
Fresh milk does not immediately<br />
turn into curd,<br />
and evil acts do not immediately<br />
show their fruits;<br />
however, fools do suffer from the consequences<br />
of their foolishness<br />
as they would be burned<br />
by standing on coals hidden in ashes.</p>

<p>72.<br />
Fools are those who use foolishly<br />
whatever gifts they have,<br />
destroying their accumulated good fortune.</p>

<p>73-74.<br />
The conceit and craving of fools grows<br />
as they claim for themselves<br />
undue authority, recognition and reward:<br />
their falsity affects their longing,<br />
they wish to be seen<br />
as powerful and discerning.</p>

<p>75.<br />
The path that leads to worldly gain<br />
and the path that leads to Liberation<br />
are different paths.<br />
Seeing thus, the renunciant disciple<br />
avoids the distraction<br />
of worldly gain and success,<br />
to dwell in solitude.</p>
