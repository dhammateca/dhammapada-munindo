<p>129.<br />
Having empathy for others,<br />
one sees that all beings are afraid<br />
of punishment and death.<br />
Knowing this,<br />
one does not attack or cause attack.</p>

<p>130.<br />
Having empathy for others,<br />
one sees that all beings<br />
love life and fear death.<br />
Knowing this,<br />
one does not attack or cause attack.</p>

<p>131.<br />
To harm living beings<br />
who, like us, seek contentment,<br />
is to bring harm to ourselves.</p>

<p>132.<br />
To avoid bringing harm to living beings<br />
who, like us, seek contentment,<br />
is to bring happiness to ourselves.</p>

<p>133.<br />
Avoid speaking harshly to others;<br />
harsh speech prompts retaliation.<br />
Those hurt by your words may hurt you back.</p>

<p>134.<br />
If spoken to harshly,<br />
make yourself as silent as a cracked gong;<br />
non-retaliation is a sign of freedom.</p>

<p>135.<br />
Just as a herdsman<br />
drives cattle to pasture,<br />
old age and death<br />
direct living beings.</p>

<p>136.<br />
Though while they perform their evil acts<br />
they do not realize what they are doing,<br />
fools suffer the results<br />
of their own actions accordingly,<br />
just as one is burnt when handling fire.</p>

<p>137-140.<br />
To cause harm to the defenceless<br />
soon brings suffering<br />
to those who attack.<br />
They will reap pain or poverty or loss,<br />
illness, insanity or persecution,<br />
abuse, distress or devastation,<br />
and, alone, after death<br />
they must confront their misdeeds.</p>

<p>141.<br />
Not outer asceticisms,<br />
nor self-humiliation,<br />
nor physical deprivation of any kind,<br />
can purify oneâ€™s heart<br />
if it is still obscured by doubt.</p>

<p>142.<br />
Flamboyant outer appearance<br />
does not in itself constitute<br />
an obstruction to freedom.<br />
Having a heart at peace,<br />
pure, contained,<br />
awake and blameless,<br />
distinguishes a renunciate,<br />
a wayfarer, a noble being.</p>

<p>143.<br />
A well-trained horse<br />
gives no cause for restraint.<br />
Rare are those beings who,<br />
through modesty and discipline,<br />
give no cause for rebuke.</p>

<p>144.<br />
Let the dread of endless mediocrity<br />
spur you into great effort,<br />
like a well-trained horse<br />
encouraged by the mere touch of the whip.<br />
Relinquish the burden of endless struggle<br />
with unapologetic confidence,<br />
with purity of action, effort, concentration,<br />
and by conscious and disciplined commitment<br />
to the path.</p>

<p>145.<br />
Those who build canals<br />
channel the flow of water.<br />
Fletchers make arrows.<br />
Woodworkers craft wood.<br />
The good tame themselves.</p>
