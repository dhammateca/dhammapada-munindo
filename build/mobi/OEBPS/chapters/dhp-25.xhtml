<h1 id="the-renunciate">The Renunciate</h1>

<p>360.<br />
It is good to restrain the eye.<br />
It is good to restrain the ear.<br />
It is good to restrain the nose.<br />
It is good to restrain the tongue.</p>

<p>361.<br />
It is good to be restrained in body.<br />
It is good to be restrained in speech.<br />
It is good to be restrained in mind.<br />
It is good to be restrained in everything.<br />
The renunciate who is restrained<br />
in every way will realize<br />
freedom from suffering.</p>

<p>362.<br />
One who is rightly disciplined<br />
in all actions,<br />
who is composed,<br />
contented and delights in<br />
solitary contemplation –<br />
such is a renunciate.</p>

<p>363.<br />
It is pleasing to hear<br />
the words of a renunciate<br />
who is wise, not inflated,<br />
whose mind is composed<br />
and whose speech is contained<br />
and clear in meaning.</p>

<p>364.<br />
One who abides in Dhamma,<br />
who delights in Dhamma,<br />
who contemplates Dhamma,<br />
who memorizes Dhamma<br />
does not lose the Way.</p>

<p>365.<br />
Bemoaning your own lot<br />
or envying the gains of others<br />
obstructs peace of mind.</p>

<p>366.<br />
But being contented<br />
even with modest gains,<br />
pure in livelihood and energetic,<br />
you will be held in high esteem.</p>

<p>367.<br />
True renunciates<br />
regard the entire body-mind<br />
without any thought of ’I’ or ’mine’<br />
and are devoid of longing<br />
for what they do not have.</p>

<p>368.<br />
A renunciate who<br />
abides in loving-kindness,<br />
with a heart full of devotion<br />
for the Buddha’s teaching,<br />
will find peace, stillness and bliss.</p>

<p>369.<br />
Bale out the water from your boat;<br />
cut loose from the defiling passions<br />
of lust and hatred;<br />
unencumbered, sail on<br />
towards liberation.</p>

<p>370.<br />
One who has<br />
cut off coarse attachments,<br />
cut off subtle attachments,<br />
who cultivates the spiritual faculties,<br />
is the one who finds freedom<br />
from delusion.</p>

<p>371.<br />
Be careful!<br />
Do not neglect meditation,<br />
nor allow the mind<br />
to dwell on sensuality<br />
lest you might heedlessly swallow<br />
a red-hot ball of iron<br />
and find yourself crying out,<br />
“Why am I suffering?”</p>

<p>372.<br />
Concentration does not arise<br />
without understanding,<br />
nor understanding<br />
without concentration.<br />
One who knows both<br />
approaches liberation.</p>

<p>373.<br />
A happiness transcending ordinary bliss<br />
is experienced by those renunciates<br />
who have entered into seclusion<br />
with tranquil heart<br />
and clear understanding of the Way.</p>

<p>374.<br />
When those who are wise<br />
dwell in contemplation<br />
on the transient nature<br />
of the body-mind<br />
and of all conditioned existence,<br />
they experience joy and delight,<br />
seeing through<br />
to the inherently secure.</p>

<p>375-376.<br />
This then is the beginning<br />
for a renunciate who takes up the training:<br />
wisely control your faculties,<br />
commit yourself to the instruction,<br />
seek contentment;<br />
cultivate the company of those<br />
who support your aspiration<br />
for energetic practice of the teachings.<br />
The beauty of pure conduct<br />
conditions whole-hearted well-being,<br />
giving rise to complete<br />
freedom from remorse.</p>

<p>377.<br />
As old flowers fall<br />
from a jasmine plant,<br />
let lust and hatred<br />
fall away.</p>

<p>378.<br />
I call them the peaceful ones,<br />
who are calm in body,<br />
in speech and in mind,<br />
and who are thoroughly purged<br />
of all worldly obsessions.</p>

<p>379.<br />
Scrutinize yourself.<br />
Examine yourself.<br />
With right attention<br />
to self assessment<br />
you will live at ease.</p>

<p>380.<br />
We are our own protection;<br />
we are indeed our own secure abiding;<br />
how could it be otherwise?<br />
So with due care<br />
we attend to ourselves.</p>

<p>381.<br />
A monk, a nun, who cultivates<br />
a joyous disposition<br />
and is filled with<br />
confidence in the Way<br />
will find peace, stillness and bliss.</p>

<p>382.<br />
While still a youth, a renunciate<br />
fully devoted to the Way<br />
lights up the world<br />
like the moon emerging from clouds.</p>
