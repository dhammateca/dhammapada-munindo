<h1 id="the-wise">The Wise</h1>

<p>76.<br />
Only blessings can arise<br />
from seeking the company<br />
of wise and discerning persons,<br />
who skilfully offer<br />
both admonition and advice<br />
as if guiding one to hidden treasure.</p>

<p>77.<br />
Let the wise guide beings away from darkness,<br />
give direction and advice.<br />
They will be treasured by the virtuous<br />
and dismissed by the foolish.</p>

<p>78.<br />
Do not seek the company of misguided friends;<br />
beware of degenerate companions.<br />
Seek the company of well-guided friends,<br />
those who support insight.</p>

<p>79.<br />
Surrendering oneself to Dhamma<br />
leads to serene being.<br />
The wise perpetually delight in the truth<br />
taught by the Awakened One.</p>

<p>80.<br />
Those who build canals<br />
channel the flow of water.<br />
Arrowsmiths make arrows.<br />
Woodworkers craft wood.<br />
The wise tame themselves.</p>

<p>81.<br />
As solid rock<br />
is unshaken by the wind,<br />
so are those with wisdom undisturbed,<br />
whether by praise or blame.</p>

<p>82.<br />
On hearing true teachings<br />
the hearts of those who are receptive<br />
become serene,<br />
like a lake, deep, clear and still.</p>

<p>83.<br />
Virtuous beings are unattached.<br />
They do not indulge in heedless speech<br />
about sensual pleasures.<br />
They experience both joy and sorrow<br />
but are possessed by neither.</p>

<p>84.<br />
Neither for one’s own sake<br />
nor on behalf of another<br />
does a wise person do harm<br />
– not for the sake of family, fortune or gain.<br />
Such a one is rightly called<br />
just, virtuous and wise.</p>

<p>85.<br />
Few are those who reach the beyond.<br />
Most pace endlessly back and forth,<br />
not daring to risk the journey.</p>

<p>86.<br />
Although it is difficult to cross over<br />
the storm-swept sea of passion,<br />
those who live in accordance<br />
with the well-taught Way<br />
arrive at the beyond.</p>

<p>87-88.<br />
With an image of liberation as the goal<br />
the wise abandon darkness<br />
and cherish light,<br />
leave petty security behind<br />
and seek freedom from attachment.<br />
To pursue such release is difficult and rare,<br />
yet the wise will seek it,<br />
detaching themselves from obstructions,<br />
purifying heart and mind.</p>

<p>89.<br />
Freeing themselves from longing,<br />
unhindered by habitual grasping,<br />
those who align themselves with the Way<br />
delight in non-attachment<br />
and, while still in the world,<br />
are radiant.</p>
