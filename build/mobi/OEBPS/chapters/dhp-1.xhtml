<p>1.<br />
All states of being are determined by the heart.<br />
It is the heart that leads the way.<br />
Just as the wheel of the oxcart follows<br />
the hoof print of the animal that draws it,<br />
so suffering will surely follow<br />
when we speak or act impulsively<br />
from an impure heart.</p>

<p>2.<br />
All states of being are determined by the heart.<br />
It is the heart that leads the way.<br />
As surely as our shadow never leaves us,<br />
so well-being will follow<br />
when we speak or act<br />
with a pure heart.</p>

<p>3.<br />
When we hold fast to such thoughts as,<br />
“They abused me, mistreated me,<br />
molested me, robbed me,”<br />
we keep hatred alive.</p>

<p>4.<br />
If we thoroughly release ourselves<br />
from such thoughts as,<br />
“They abused me, mistreated me,<br />
molested me, robbed me,”<br />
hatred is vanquished.</p>

<p>5.<br />
Never by hatred is hatred conquered,<br />
but by readiness to love alone.<br />
This is eternal law.</p>

<p>6.<br />
Those who are contentious<br />
have forgotten that we all die;<br />
for the wise, who reflect on this fact,<br />
there are no quarrels.</p>

<p>7.<br />
As a stormy wind can uproot a frail tree,<br />
so one who holds heedlessly to pleasure,<br />
who indulges in food and is indolent,<br />
can be uprooted by Mara.</p>

<p>8.<br />
As a stormy wind<br />
cannot move a mountain of rock,<br />
so one who contemplates<br />
the reality of the body,<br />
who develops faith and energy,<br />
is unmoved by Mara.</p>

<p>9.<br />
Wearing the robe of a renunciate<br />
does not in itself render one pure.<br />
Those who wear it and yet lack diligence<br />
are heedless.</p>

<p>10.<br />
Being possessed of self-restraint,<br />
honest and diligent in conduct;<br />
such a one is worthy<br />
of the renunciate’s robe.</p>

<p>11.<br />
Mistaking the false for the real<br />
and the real for the false,<br />
one suffers a life of falsity.</p>

<p>12.<br />
But, seeing the false as the false<br />
and the real as the real,<br />
one lives in the perfectly real.</p>

<p>13.<br />
Like rain leaking through<br />
a poorly-thatched roof,<br />
the unruly passions<br />
seep into an untamed heart.</p>

<p>14.<br />
As rain cannot penetrate<br />
a well-thatched roof,<br />
so the passions<br />
cannot enter a well-trained heart.</p>

<p>15.<br />
When we see clearly<br />
our own lack of virtue<br />
we are filled with grief;<br />
here and hereafter we grieve.</p>

<p>16.<br />
When we appreciate fully<br />
the benefit of our own pure deeds<br />
we are filled with joy;<br />
here and hereafter<br />
there is a celebration of joy.</p>

<p>17.<br />
Here and hereafter<br />
those who perform evil<br />
create their own suffering.<br />
Mental preoccupation<br />
with the thought, “I have done wrong”<br />
possesses their minds,<br />
and they fall into chaos.</p>

<p>18.<br />
Here and hereafter<br />
those who live their lives well<br />
abide in happiness.<br />
They are filled<br />
with a natural appreciation of virtue,<br />
and they dwell in delight.</p>

<p>19.<br />
Though one may know<br />
much about Dhamma,<br />
if one does not live accordingly –<br />
like a cowherd<br />
who covets another’s cattle –<br />
one experiences none of the benefits<br />
of walking the Way.</p>

<p>20.<br />
Knowing only a little about Dhamma<br />
but wholeheartedly according with it,<br />
transforming the passions<br />
of greed, hatred and delusion,<br />
releasing all attachments to here and hereafter,<br />
one will indeed experience for oneself<br />
the benefits of walking the Way.</p>
