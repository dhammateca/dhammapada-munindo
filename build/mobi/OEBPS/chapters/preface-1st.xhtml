<p><em>To the first edition (2000)</em></p>

<p>It is my hope that this <em>Dhammapada for Contemplation</em> will delight those
who come across it and serve to encourage further viewings from
different perspectives. I trust that whatever glimpses of truth may be
gained, however briefly, will encourage all travellers to continue
faring on.</p>

<p>Any gratitude arising from the reading should be directed towards the
earlier translators on whose work I have been wholly dependent: Daw Mya
Tin and the editors of the Burmese Pitaka Association (1987), Ven.
Narada Thera (B.M.S. 1978), and Ven. Ananda Maitreya Thera (Lotsawa
1988); also to the many friends whose contributions have added richness
and depth, especially Ajahn Thiradhammo, Sister Medhanandi, Bani Shorter
and Thomas Jones.</p>

<p>Responsibility for any defects that may remain rests with me.</p>
