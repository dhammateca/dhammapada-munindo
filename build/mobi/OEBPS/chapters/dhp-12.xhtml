<h1 id="the-self">The Self</h1>

<p>157.<br />
If we hold ourselves dear,<br />
then we maintain careful self-regard<br />
both day and night.</p>

<p>158.<br />
It is wise<br />
to set ourselves right<br />
before instructing others.</p>

<p>159.<br />
Oneâ€™s own self is the hardest to discipline.<br />
You should act as you teach:<br />
tame yourself<br />
before trying to tame others.</p>

<p>160.<br />
Truly it is ourselves<br />
that we depend upon;<br />
how could we really<br />
depend upon another?<br />
When we reach the state<br />
of self-reliance<br />
we find a rare refuge.</p>

<p>161.<br />
As a diamond can cut through<br />
the stone that once housed it,<br />
so your own evil can grind you down.</p>

<p>162.<br />
Committed evil-doers<br />
behave towards themselves<br />
like their own worst enemies.<br />
They are like creepers<br />
that strangle the trees<br />
which support them.</p>

<p>163.<br />
It is easy to do that which is<br />
of no real benefit to oneself,<br />
but it is difficult indeed to do that<br />
which is truly beneficial and good.</p>

<p>164.<br />
Like the bamboo<br />
which destroys itself as it bears fruit,<br />
so fools harm themselves<br />
by holding to wrong views<br />
and deriding those worthy ones<br />
who live in harmony with the Way.</p>

<p>165.<br />
By ourselves we do evil<br />
and by ourselves we are made impure.<br />
By ourselves we avoid evil<br />
and by ourselves we are made pure.<br />
The great matter of purity<br />
is our own affair.<br />
No other can be responsible.</p>

<p>166.<br />
Knowing the Way for oneself,<br />
walk it thoroughly.<br />
Do not allow the needs of others,<br />
however demanding,<br />
to bring about distraction.</p>
