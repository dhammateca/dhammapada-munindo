<h1 id="anger">Anger</h1>

<p>221.<br />
Relinquish anger.<br />
Let go of conceit.<br />
Release yourself<br />
from all that binds you.<br />
The pure-hearted who cling<br />
neither to body or mind<br />
do not fall prey to suffering.</p>

<p>222.<br />
I say that those who contain anger<br />
as a charioteer controls<br />
a speeding chariot<br />
are fully in charge of their lives;<br />
others are merely keeping<br />
their hands on the reins.</p>

<p>223.<br />
Transform anger with kindness<br />
and badness with that which is good,<br />
meanness with generosity<br />
and deceit with integrity.</p>

<p>224.<br />
These three ways<br />
lead to the heavens:<br />
asserting the truth,<br />
not yielding to anger,<br />
and giving, even if you have<br />
only a little to share.</p>

<p>225.<br />
Awakened Ones do not cause harm.<br />
They are rightly restrained<br />
and they move to changelessness<br />
where they grieve no more.</p>

<p>226.<br />
All pollution is cleared<br />
from the minds of those<br />
who are always vigilant,<br />
training themselves day and night,<br />
and whose lives are fully intent<br />
upon liberation.</p>

<p>227.<br />
Since ancient times it has been the case<br />
that those who speak too much are criticized,<br />
as are those who speak too little<br />
and those who don’t speak at all.<br />
Everyone in this world is criticized.</p>

<p>228.<br />
There never was,<br />
nor will there be,<br />
nor is there now, anybody<br />
who is only blamed<br />
or wholly praised.</p>

<p>229.<br />
Those who live impeccably,<br />
who are discerning,<br />
intelligent and virtuous –<br />
they are continually praised by the wise.</p>

<p>230.<br />
Who would cast blame on those<br />
who in their being are like gold?<br />
Even the gods praise them.</p>

<p>231.<br />
Beware of clumsy movement<br />
and be aware in your bodily conduct.<br />
Renounce all devious action<br />
and cultivate that which is wholesome.</p>

<p>232.<br />
Beware of contrived utterance<br />
and be aware in all that you say.<br />
Renounce all cunning speech<br />
and cultivate that which is wholesome.</p>

<p>233.<br />
Beware of devious thinking<br />
and be aware of all that you dwell upon.<br />
Renounce all unruly thought<br />
and cultivate that which is wholesome.</p>

<p>234.<br />
Ably self-restrained<br />
are the wise,<br />
in action, in thought<br />
and in speech.</p>
