Introduction
============

The book you hold is a sparkling basket of light, full of illumination
of the human situation. It is a version of the Buddhist classic, the
Dhammapada; not a line-by-line translation but a free rendering that
aims to communicate the living spirit of the text, unencumbered by rigid
adherence to formal exactness. The intention of the author, Ajahn
Munindo, was to present a contemporary version of the text for readers
to use in their investigation of the Way. Hence its title is *A
Dhammapada for Contemplation*, indicating that the work is not to be
considered as a definitive translation, but as an invitation to
encounter and to contemplate the Buddha’s wisdom.

It is a life of contemplation that is the context for this rendering.
Ajahn Munindo, who was born in New Zealand, was ordained as a bhikkhu or
monk of the Theravadan tradition in Thailand twenty-five years ago. He
now resides in a small spiritual community in Northumberland, England,
where he lives under a code of discipline going back to the Buddha,
which encourages simplicity and right attention. Transplanting this
Buddhist monastic way of life from the eastern countries where Buddhism
has been long established into the West has meant a process of
translation involving language, practices and rituals, such that the
Theravadan tradition, along with others, is now established within the
Western cultural ambience. *A Dhammapada for Contemplation*, therefore,
although a free rendering by scholarly standards, aims to communicate a
precise translation of values — the spiritual values of the living
Buddhist tradition.

Preface (1st)
=============

*To the first edition (2000)*

It is my hope that this *Dhammapada for Contemplation* will delight
those who come across it and serve to encourage further viewings from
different perspectives. I trust that whatever glimpses of truth may be
gained, however briefly, will encourage all travellers to continue
faring on.

Any gratitude arising from the reading should be directed towards the
earlier translators on whose work I have been wholly dependent: Daw Mya
Tin and the editors of the Burmese Pitaka Association (1987), Ven.
Narada Thera (B.M.S. 1978), and Ven. Ananda Maitreya Thera (Lotsawa
1988); also to the many friends whose contributions have added richness
and depth, especially Ajahn Thiradhammo, Sister Medhanandi, Bani Shorter
and Thomas Jones.

Responsibility for any defects that may remain rests with me.

*To the second edition (2006)*

Over five years have passed since we printed the first edition of this
*Dhammapada for Contemplation*. I am happy that the first edition was
met with so much appreciation. Now, on the occasion of celebrating 25
years since the establishing of Aruna Ratanagiri Monastery here on
Harnham Hill, it is a joy to have an opportunity for a reprint. It has
also been an opportunity to re-craft some of the verses.

I am indebted to Thanissaro Bhikkhu for his new translation of *The
Dhammapada* (Dhamma Dana Pubs. Barre, MA.1998) which was usefully
consulted. I am most grateful to all those who offered comments on this
new edition.

=============

*To the third edition (2010)*

This year Luang Por Sumedho has announced he will return to Thailand
after thirty-three years in Britain. Some of those whose lives have been
changed by receiving Dhamma teachings from Luang Por wish to express
their gratitude by reprinting my rendering of the Dhammapada. I am
delighted to support this.

I have taken the opportunity to make a few minor corrections and
alterations, otherwise the text of this *Dhammapada for Contemplation*
remains the same as previous editions.

Preface (4th)
=============

*To the fourth edition (2015)*

We continue to receive requests for copies of this *Dhammapada for
Contemplation* and are grateful to our good friends in Malaysia for
making a reprint possible.

As well as using resources mentioned above in earlier editions, in
adjusting some verses I have had the benefit of translations by Bhikkhu
Thanissaro and Acharya Buddharakkhita (see
[www.accesstoinsight.org](http://accesstoinsight.org)).

For those who are interested, these are the verses I have significantly
reworked: 1, 2, 36, 78, 95, 123, 141, 183, 198, 223, 231, 232, 233, 244,
331, 332, 333, 383, 384, 421. Otherwise, the text of this rendering of
the Dhammapada remains mostly the same as previous editions.

As before, I encourage readers to refer to other versions of the
Dhammapada, particularly those mentioned as resources for this book.

Preface (5th)
=============

*To the 5th edition (2016)*

Once more we are grateful to our good friends in Malaysia for making
another reprint of this small booklet possible.

As with earlier editions several resources have been consulted including
translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Acharya Buddharakkhita (see
[www.accesstoinsight.org](http://accesstoinsight.org)).

For those who are interested, these are the verses I have significantly
reworked: 21, 22, 57, 118, 418. Otherwise, the text of this rendering of
the Dhammapada remains mostly the same as previous editions. Readers are
strongly encouraged to refer to other versions of the Dhammapada.

1. The Pairs
============

1.\
All states of being are determined by the heart.\
It is the heart that leads the way.\
Just as the wheel of the oxcart follows\
the hoof print of the animal that draws it,\
so suffering will surely follow\
when we speak or act impulsively\
from an impure heart.

2.\
All states of being are determined by the heart.\
It is the heart that leads the way.\
As surely as our shadow never leaves us,\
so well-being will follow\
when we speak or act\
with a pure heart.

3.\
When we hold fast to such thoughts as,\
“They abused me, mistreated me,\
molested me, robbed me,”\
we keep hatred alive.

4.\
If we thoroughly release ourselves\
from such thoughts as,\
“They abused me, mistreated me,\
molested me, robbed me,”\
hatred is vanquished.

5.\
Never by hatred is hatred conquered,\
but by readiness to love alone.\
This is eternal law.

6.\
Those who are contentious\
have forgotten that we all die;\
for the wise, who reflect on this fact,\
there are no quarrels.

7.\
As a stormy wind can uproot a frail tree,\
so one who holds heedlessly to pleasure,\
who indulges in food and is indolent\
can be uprooted by Mara.

8.\
As a stormy wind\
cannot move a mountain of rock,\
so one who contemplates\
the reality of the body,\
who develops faith and energy,\
is unmoved by Mara.

9.\
Wearing the robe of a renunciate\
does not in itself render one pure.\
Those who wear it and yet lack diligence\
are heedless.

10.\
Being possessed of self-restraint,\
honest and diligent in conduct;\
such a one is worthy\
of the renunciate’s robe.

11.\
Mistaking the false for the real\
and the real for the false,\
one suffers a life of falsity.

12.\
But seeing the false as the false\
and the real as the real,\
one lives in the perfectly real.

13.\
Like rain leaking through\
a poorly-thatched roof,\
the unruly passions\
seep into an untamed heart.

14.\
As rain cannot penetrate\
a well-thatched roof,\
so the passions\
cannot enter a well-trained heart.

15.\
When we see clearly\
our own lack of virtue\
we are filled with grief;\
here and hereafter we grieve.

16.\
When we appreciate fully\
the benefit of our own pure deeds\
we are filled with joy;\
here and hereafter\
there is a celebration of joy.

17.\
Here and hereafter\
those who perform evil\
create their own suffering.\
Mental preoccupation\
with the thought, “I have done wrong”\
possesses their minds,\
and they fall into chaos.

18.\
Here and hereafter\
those who live their lives well\
abide in happiness.\
They are filled\
with a natural appreciation of virtue,\
and they dwell in delight.

19.\
Though one may know\
much about Dhamma,\
if one does not live accordingly –\
like a cowherd\
who covets another’s cattle –\
one experiences none of the benefits\
of walking the Way.

20.\
Knowing only a little about Dhamma\
but wholeheartedly according with it,\
transforming the passions\
of greed, hatred and delusion,\
releasing all attachments to here and hereafter,\
one will indeed experience for oneself\
the benefits of walking the Way.

2. Awareness
============

21.\
Heedfulness leads to the Deathless;\
heedlessness leads to death.\
Those who are heedful are fully alive,\
while those who are heedless\
are as if already dead.

22.\
The wise, being fully alive,\
rejoice in heedfulness,\
and abide delighting\
in this ability.

23.\
The Awakened Ones, firm in their resolve,\
vigorously apply themselves,\
and know freedom from all limitation:\
liberation, true security.

24.\
Those who are energetically\
committed to the Way,\
who are pure and considerate in effort,\
composed and virtuous in conduct,\
steadily increase in radiance.

25.\
By endeavour, vigilance,\
restraint and self-control,\
let the wise make islands of themselves\
which no flood can overwhelm.

26.\
Those who are foolish and confused\
betray themselves to heedlessness.\
The wise treasure the awareness\
they have cultivated\
as their most precious possession.

27.\
“Do not become lost in negligence,\
do not become lost in sensuality.”\
Heeding such counsel,\
the contemplative discovers\
profound release.

28.\
Those Awakened Ones\
who have tasted freedom\
from all distraction\
by cultivating awareness\
view all who are suffering\
with compassionate perspective,\
as one on a mountain top\
is able to view the plains.

29.\
Aware among those who are heedless,\
awake among those who sleep,\
the wise go forward like strong young horses,\
leaving the exhausted behind.

30.\
By way of diligent awareness\
the god Magha won his realm.\
Diligence is ever rewarded,\
negligence is ever scorned.

31.\
The renunciate who delights in vigilance\
and shuns heedlessness\
advances like a grass fire,\
consuming obstructions great and small.

32.\
The renunciate who delights in vigilance\
and shuns heedlessness\
is protected from regression:\
such a one approaches liberation.

3. The Mind
===========

33.\
Just as a fletcher shapes an arrow,\
so the wise develop the mind,\
so excitable, uncertain\
and difficult to control.

34.\
As a fish which on being dragged\
from its home in the water\
and tossed on dry land\
will thrash about,\
so will the heart tremble\
when withdrawing from the current of Mara.

35.\
The active mind is difficult to tame,\
flighty and wandering wherever it wills:\
taming it is essential,\
leading to the joy of well-being.

36.\
The protected and guarded mind\
leads to ease of being.\
Though this mind is subtle,\
elusive and difficult to see,\
one who is alert should tend\
and watch over it.

37.\
Wandering far and wide on its own,\
without form,\
the mind lies in the heart-cavern within.\
To bring it under control\
is to be freed from the bonds of ignorance.

38.\
In one whose mind is unsteady,\
whose heart is not prepared\
with true teachings,\
whose faith is not matured,\
the fullness of wisdom is not yet manifest.

39.\
There is no fear\
if the heart is uncontaminated\
by the passions\
and the mind is free from ill-will.\
Seeing beyond good and evil,\
one is awake.

40.\
Seeing this body to be as fragile as a clay vessel,\
and fortifying the heart like a city wall,\
one can confront Mara\
with the weapon of insight.\
Having the advantage of non-attachment,\
one protects what has already been gained.

41.\
Certainly this body will soon lie lifeless:\
cast aside on the ground,\
devoid of consciousness\
and as useless as a burnt-out log.

42.\
More than a thief,\
more than an enemy,\
a misdirected heart\
brings one to harm.

43.\
Neither mother, father\
nor any member of a family\
can give you the blessings generated\
by your own well-directed heart.

4. Flowers
==========

44.\
Who is it\
that can truly see as they are\
this earth, this body,\
the hell realms and the heavenly realms?\
Who can discern\
the well-taught Path of Wisdom,\
in the way the eye of a skilled florist\
can select perfect blooms?

45.\
It is those who knowingly walk the Way\
who can see as they truly are\
this earth, this body,\
the hell realms and the heavenly realms.\
They are the ones who can discern\
the well-taught Path of Wisdom.

46.\
Know the body\
to be as transient as foam, a mirage.\
The flower of sensual passion\
has a hidden barb.\
See this and pass beyond death.

47.\
As a flash flood\
can sweep away a sleeping village,\
so death can destroy\
those who only seek the flowers\
of casual sensual pleasures.

48.\
To be frustrated and ungratified,\
yet still only seek the flowers\
of casual sensual pleasures\
brings one under the destroyer’s sway.

49.\
As a bee gathering nectar\
does not harm or disturb\
the colour and fragrance of the flower,\
so do the wise move\
through the world.

50.\
Dwell not on the faults\
and shortcomings of others,\
instead, seek clarity\
about your own.

51.\
As a beautiful flower\
without fragrance is disappointing,\
so are wise words\
without right action.

52.\
As a beautiful flower\
with a delightful fragrance is pleasing,\
so is wise and lovely speech\
when matched with right action.

53.\
As many garlands can be made\
from a heap of flowers,\
so too, much that is wholesome can be done\
during this human existence.

54.\
The fragrance of flowers or sandalwood\
blows only with the prevailing wind,\
but the fragrance of virtue\
pervades all directions.

55.\
The fragrance of virtue\
surpasses by far\
the fragrance of flowers\
or sandalwood.

56.\
The aroma of sandalwood\
and the scent of flowers\
bring only little delight\
compared to the fragrance of virtue,\
which suffuses even the heavenly realms.

57.\
It is not possible for Mara to find\
those who abide in heedfulness,\
who by perfect knowledge are freed\
and live in virtue.

58-59.\
Just as a sweet-smelling and beautiful lotus\
can grow from a pile of discarded waste,\
the radiance of a true disciple of the Buddha\
outshines dark shadows cast by ignorance.

5. The Foolish
==============

60.\
The night is long\
for one who cannot sleep.\
A journey is long for one who is tired.\
Ignorant existence is long and tedious\
for those unaware of Truth.

61.\
Having found no companion\
who has travelled at least as far as ourselves,\
it is better to go alone\
than to accompany those\
who remain irresolute.

62.\
“This is my child, this is my wealth”:\
such thoughts are the preoccupations of fools.\
If we are unable to own even ourselves,\
why make such claims?

63.\
The fool who knows he is a fool\
is at least a little wise;\
the fool who thinks that he is wise\
is assuredly a fool.

64.\
Like spoons unable to taste\
the flavour of the soup\
are the fools who cannot see truth,\
even though they live\
all their lives among the wise.

65.\
Like the tongue that can appreciate\
the flavour of the soup\
is one who can clearly discern the truth\
after only a brief\
association with the wise.

66.\
By heedlessly performing evil,\
unwary fools produce their own bitter fruits.\
They behave like their worst enemy.

67.\
A deed is not well-done\
when upon reflection remorse arises:\
with tears of sorrow\
one harvests its fruit.

68.\
A deed is well-done\
when upon reflection no remorse arises:\
with joy one harvests its fruits.

69.\
Fools perceive evil acts\
to be sweet as honey\
until they have seen the consequences.\
When they behold their fruits,\
fools suffer indeed.

70.\
Even after months of rigid asceticism,\
subsisting on a frugal diet,\
a fool is not to be compared in value\
to the person who simply sees the truth.

71.\
Fresh milk does not immediately\
turn into curd,\
and evil acts do not immediately\
show their fruits;\
however, fools do suffer from the consequences\
of their foolishness\
as they would be burned\
by standing on coals hidden in ashes.

72.\
Fools are those who use foolishly\
whatever gifts they have,\
destroying their accumulated good fortune.

73-74.\
The conceit and craving of fools grows\
as they claim for themselves\
undue authority, recognition and reward:\
their falsity affects their longing,\
they wish to be seen\
as powerful and discerning.

75.\
The path that leads to worldly gain\
and the path that leads to Liberation\
are different paths.\
Seeing thus, the renunciant disciple\
avoids the distraction\
of worldly gain and success,\
to dwell in solitude.

6. The Wise
===========

76.\
Only blessings can arise\
from seeking the company\
of wise and discerning persons,\
who skilfully offer\
both admonition and advice\
as if guiding one to hidden treasure.

77.\
Let the wise guide beings away from darkness,\
give direction and advice.\
They will be treasured by the virtuous\
and dismissed by the foolish.

78.\
Do not seek the company of misguided friends;\
beware of degenerate companions.\
Seek the company of well-guided friends,\
those who support insight.

79.\
Surrendering oneself to Dhamma\
leads to serene being.\
The wise perpetually delight in the truth\
taught by the Awakened One.

80.\
Those who build canals\
channel the flow of water.\
Arrowsmiths make arrows.\
Woodworkers craft wood.\
The wise tame themselves.

81.\
As solid rock\
is unshaken by the wind,\
so are those with wisdom undisturbed,\
whether by praise or blame.

82.\
On hearing true teachings\
the hearts of those who are receptive\
become serene,\
like a lake, deep, clear and still.

83.\
Virtuous beings are unattached.\
They do not indulge in heedless speech\
about sensual pleasures.\
They experience both joy and sorrow\
but are possessed by neither.

84.\
Neither for one’s own sake\
nor on behalf of another\
does a wise person do harm\
– not for the sake of family, fortune or gain.\
Such a one is rightly called\
just, virtuous and wise.

85.\
Few are those who reach the beyond.\
Most pace endlessly back and forth,\
not daring to risk the journey.

86.\
Although it is difficult to cross over\
the storm-swept sea of passion,\
those who live in accordance\
with the well-taught Way\
arrive at the beyond.

87-88.\
With an image of liberation as the goal\
the wise abandon darkness\
and cherish light,\
leave petty security behind\
and seek freedom from attachment.\
To pursue such release is difficult and rare,\
yet the wise will seek it,\
detaching themselves from obstructions,\
purifying heart and mind.

89.\
Freeing themselves from longing,\
unhindered by habitual grasping,\
those who align themselves with the Way\
delight in non-attachment\
and, while still in the world,\
are radiant.

7. The Awakened One
===================

90.\
There is no tension\
for those who have completed their journey\
and have become free\
from the distress of all binding ties.

91.\
Alert to the needs of the journey,\
those on the path of awareness,\
like swans, glide on,\
leaving behind their former resting places.

92.\
Just like birds that leave no tracks in the air,\
there are those whose minds do not cling\
to temptations that are offered to them.\
Their focus is the signless state of liberation,\
which to others is indiscernible.

93.\
There are those\
who are free from all obstructions;\
they do not worry about food.\
Their focus is the signless state of liberation.\
Like birds flying through the air,\
trackless they move on their way.

94.\
Like horses well-trained by their owners\
are those who have rightly tamed their senses;\
having freed their hearts\
from pride and pollution\
they generate all-pervading delight.

95.\
There are those who discover\
they can completely abandon\
confused reactions\
and become patient as the earth;\
unmoved by anger,\
unshaken as a pillar,\
unperturbed as a clear and quiet pool.

96.\
Those who arrive\
at the state of perfect freedom\
through right understanding\
are unperturbed\
in body, speech or mind.\
They remain unshaken\
by life’s vicissitudes.

97.\
Those who know the uncreated,\
who are free and stilled,\
who have discarded all craving,\
are the most worthy beings.

98.\
Whether in a forest,\
a town or open country,\
delightful is the dwelling place\
of one now fully free.

99.\
Beings free from addiction to sensual pleasures\
know a unique form of delight.\
They seek quiet in forest retreats\
which worldly beings would avoid.

8. The Thousands
================

100.\
A single word of truth\
which calms the mind\
is better to hear than a thousand\
irrelevant words.

101.\
A single verse of truth\
which calms the mind\
is better to hear than a thousand\
irrelevant verses.

102.\
Reciting a single verse of truth\
which calms the mind\
is better than reciting\
a hundred meaningless verses.

103.\
One might defeat alone in battle\
a thousand thousand men,\
but one who gains self-mastery\
is by far the greater hero.

104-105.\
Self-mastery is the supreme victory –\
much more to be valued\
than winning control over others.\
It is a victory\
that no other being whatsoever\
can distort or take away.

106.\
To honour, even for a single moment,\
one who has attained self-mastery\
is of greater merit\
than making countless offerings\
to those who are unworthy.

107.\
To honour, even for a single moment,\
one who has attained self-mastery\
is of greater benefit than a hundred years\
spent habitually performing ceremonies\
based on wrong understanding.

108.\
Even if one should spend\
an entire year\
making gestures of offering\
for the sake of self-gain,\
all this is not worth one quarter the value\
of offering veneration to a noble being.

109.\
For one who always honours and respects\
those of greater years\
there are four blessings:\
long life, beauty, happiness and strength.

110.\
A single day lived\
with conscious intention and virtue\
is of greater value than a hundred years\
lived devoid of discipline and right restraint.

111.\
A single day lived\
with conscious intention and wisdom\
is of greater value than a hundred years\
lived devoid of discipline and wisdom.

112.\
A single day lived\
with conscious intention and profound effort\
is of greater value than a hundred years\
lived in lazy passivity.

113.\
A single day lived in awareness\
of the transient nature of life\
is of greater value than a hundred years\
lived unaware of birth and death.

114.\
A single day lived awake to the undying state\
is of greater value than a hundred years\
lived without recognizing deathlessness.

115.\
A single day lived awake to profound truth\
is of greater value than a hundred years\
lived unawakened.

9. Evil
=======

116.\
Hasten towards doing what is wholesome.\
Restrain your mind from evil acts.\
The mind that is slow to do good\
can easily find pleasure in evil-doing.

117.\
If you perform an evil act,\
then do not repeat it.\
Avoid finding pleasure in its memory.\
The aftermath of evil-doing is painful.

118.\
Having performed a wholesome deed\
it is good to repeat it, again and again.\
Be interested in the pleasure of wholesomeness.\
The fruit of accumulated goodness is\
contentment.

119.\
Even those who perform evil\
can experience well-being\
so long as their actions\
have not yet borne direct fruits.\
However, when the results\
of their actions ripen,\
the painful consequences\
cannot be avoided.

120.\
Even those who live wholesome lives\
can experience suffering\
so long as their acts\
have not yet borne direct fruit.\
However, when the fruits\
of their actions ripen,\
the joyful consequences\
cannot be avoided.

121.\
Do not ignore the effects of evil,\
saying, “This will come to nothing.”\
Just as by the gradual fall of raindrops\
the water jar is filled,\
so in time fools are corrupted\
by evil-doing.

122.\
Do not ignore the effect of right action,\
saying, “This will come to nothing.”\
Just as by the gradual fall of raindrops\
the water jar is filled,\
so in time the wise\
become replete with good.

123.\
As a trader with valuable cargo avoids threats\
and those who love life avoid poison,\
so you should avoid evil actions.

124.\
A hand without an open wound\
can carry poison\
and remain free from harm;\
likewise, evil has no consequences\
for those who do not perform it.

125.\
If you intentionally harm\
an innocent person,\
someone who is pure and blameless,\
the harm will come back to you\
like fine dust thrown into the wind.

126.\
Some are reborn as humans;\
evil-doers are reborn in hell.\
Doers of good are reborn in bliss\
and the pure enter the trackless land.

127.\
There is no place on earth\
where one can hide\
from the consequences of evil actions –\
not in a mountain cave,\
the ocean, nor in the sky.

128.\
There is no place on earth\
beyond the reach of death –\
not in a mountain cave,\
the ocean, nor in the sky.

10. Aggression
==============

129.\
Having empathy for others,\
one sees that all beings are afraid\
of punishment and death.\
Knowing this,\
one does not attack or cause attack.

130.\
Having empathy for others,\
one sees that all beings\
love life and fear death.\
Knowing this,\
one does not attack or cause attack.

131.\
To harm living beings\
who, like us, seek contentment,\
is to bring harm to ourselves.

132.\
To avoid bringing harm to living beings\
who, like us, seek contentment,\
is to bring happiness to ourselves.

133.\
Avoid speaking harshly to others;\
harsh speech prompts retaliation.\
Those hurt by your words may hurt you back.

134.\
If spoken to harshly,\
make yourself as silent as a cracked gong;\
non-retaliation is a sign of freedom.

135.\
Just as a herdsman\
drives cattle to pasture,\
old age and death\
direct living beings.

136.\
Though while they perform their evil acts\
they do not realize what they are doing,\
fools suffer the results\
of their own actions accordingly,\
just as one is burnt when handling fire.

137-140.\
To cause harm to the defenceless\
soon brings suffering\
to those who attack.\
They will reap pain or poverty or loss,\
illness, insanity or persecution,\
abuse, distress or devastation,\
and, alone, after death\
they must confront their misdeeds.

141.\
Not outer asceticisms,\
nor self-humiliation,\
nor physical deprivation of any kind\
can purify one’s heart\
if it is still obscured by doubt.

142.\
Flamboyant outer appearance\
does not in itself constitute\
an obstruction to freedom.\
Having a heart at peace,\
pure, contained,\
awake and blameless,\
distinguishes a renunciate,\
a wayfarer, a noble being.

143.\
A well-trained horse\
gives no cause for restraint.\
Rare are those beings who,\
through modesty and discipline,\
give no cause for rebuke.

144.\
Let the dread of endless mediocrity\
spur you into great effort,\
like a well-trained horse\
encouraged by the mere touch of the whip.\
Relinquish the burden of endless struggle\
with unapologetic confidence,\
with purity of action, effort, concentration,\
and by conscious and disciplined commitment\
to the path.

145.\
Those who build canals\
channel the flow of water.\
Fletchers make arrows.\
Woodworkers craft wood.\
The good tame themselves.

11. Old Age
===========

146.\
Why is there laughter?\
Why is there joy\
when the world is on fire?\
Since you are clouded in darkness\
should you not seek the light?

147.\
Gaze upon this once-decorated body –\
it used to attract attention\
but now it is only festering flesh,\
a putrid thing.\
It is neither sure nor substantial.

148.\
This body wears out with age;\
it becomes a host to disease\
- vulnerable, fragile,\
a decrepit, disintegrating mass,\
which eventually ends in death.

149.\
What pleasure does life hold\
once one has seen\
old bleached bones\
discarded and scattered round?

150.\
The physical body consists of bones\
covered with flesh and blood.\
Stored up inside it\
are decay and death, pride and malice.

151.\
Passed down by the wise\
is the knowledge that\
though what is externally impressive\
loses its splendour,\
and though our bodies will decay,\
the truth itself outlasts all degeneration.

152.\
While ageing fools put on weight\
like oxen in their stalls,\
their minds remain small.

153-154.\
For many lives I have wandered\
looking for, but not finding,\
the house-builder\
who caused my suffering.\
But now you are seen and\
you shall build no more.\
Your rafters are dislodged and\
the ridge-pole is broken.\
All craving is ended;\
my heart is as one with the unmade.

155.\
Those who, while still young,\
neither choose a life of renunciation\
nor earn a good living,\
end up like dejected old herons\
beside a pond without fish.

156.\
Those who, while still young,\
neither choose a life of renunciation\
nor earn a good living,\
will end up bemoaning the past,\
falling like spent arrows\
that have missed their mark.

12. The Self
============

157.\
If we hold ourselves dear,\
then we maintain careful self-regard\
both day and night.

158.\
It is wise\
to set ourselves right\
before instructing others.

159.\
One’s own self is the hardest to discipline.\
You should act as you teach:\
tame yourself\
before trying to tame others.

160.\
Truly it is ourselves\
that we depend upon;\
how could we really\
depend upon another?\
When we reach the state\
of self-reliance\
we find a rare refuge.

161.\
As a diamond can cut through\
the stone that once housed it,\
so your own evil can grind you down.

162.\
Committed evil-doers\
behave towards themselves\
like their own worst enemies.\
They are like creepers\
that strangle the trees\
which support them.

163.\
It is easy to do that which is\
of no real benefit to oneself,\
but it is difficult indeed to do that\
which is truly beneficial and good.

164.\
Like the bamboo\
which destroys itself as it bears fruit,\
so fools harm themselves\
by holding to wrong views\
and deriding those worthy ones\
who live in harmony with the Way.

165.\
By ourselves we do evil\
and by ourselves we are made impure.\
By ourselves we avoid evil\
and by ourselves we are made pure.\
The great matter of purity\
is our own affair.\
No other can be responsible.

166.\
Knowing the Way for oneself,\
walk it thoroughly.\
Do not allow the needs of others,\
however demanding,\
to bring about distraction.

13. The World
=============

167.\
By renouncing unworthy ways\
and by not living carelessly,\
by not holding to false views,\
we no longer perpetuate delusion.

168.\
Do not show false humility.\
Stand firmly in relation to your goal.\
Practice, well-observed,\
leads to contentment\
both now and in the future.

169.\
Live your life well in accord with the Way –\
avoid a life of distraction.\
A life well-lived leads to contentment\
both now and in the future.

170.\
The King of Death cannot find\
those who look upon the world\
as insubstantial,\
as transient, a bubble –\
illusive, only a mirage.

171.\
Come, view this world.\
See it as an ornate festive carriage.\
See how fools are entranced by their visions,\
yet for the wise there is no attachment.

172.\
There are those\
who awaken from heedlessness.\
They bring light into the world\
like the moon\
emerging from clouds.

173.\
One who transforms old and heedless ways\
into fresh and wholesome acts\
brings light into the world\
like the moon freed from clouds.

174.\
If birds are trapped in a net\
only a few will ever escape.\
In this world of illusion\
only a few see their way to liberation.

175.\
White swans rise into the air.\
Adept yogis\
transport themselves through space.\
Wise beings\
transcend worldly delusion\
by outwitting the hordes of Mara.

176.\
For one who transgresses\
the law of truthfulness,\
one who has no regard\
for a future existence,\
there is no manner of evil\
that is impossible.

177.\
Those who fail to value generosity\
do not reach the celestial realms.\
But the wise rejoice in giving\
and forever abide in bliss.

178.\
Better than ruling the whole world,\
better than going to heaven,\
better than lordship over the universe,\
is an irreversible commitment to the Way.

14. The Buddha
==============

179.\
The Buddha’s perfection is complete;\
there is no more work to be done.\
No measure is there for his wisdom;\
no limits are there to be found.\
In what way could he be distracted\
from truth?

180.\
The Buddha’s perfection is complete;\
in him there is no craving\
that could drag him down.\
No measure is there for his wisdom;\
no limits are there to be found.\
In what way could he be distracted\
from truth?

181.\
Celestial beings treasure\
the Awakened Ones\
who have fully seen the Way,\
who are devoted to meditation\
and delight in the peace\
of renunciation.

182.\
It is not easy to be born as a human being\
and to live this mortal life.\
It is not easy to have the opportunity\
to hear Dhamma\
and rare for a Buddha to arise.

183.\
Refrain from doing evil,\
cultivate that which is good,\
purify the heart.\
This is the Way of the Awakened Ones.

184.\
A renunciate does not\
oppress anyone.\
Patient endurance\
is the ultimate asceticism.\
Profound liberation,\
say the Buddhas,\
is the supreme goal.

185.\
Not insulting, not harming,\
cultivating restraint,\
with respect for the training,\
modesty in eating and contentment\
with one’s dwelling place,\
devotion to mindful intent:\
this is the teaching of the Buddha.

186-187.\
Not in great wealth\
is there contentment,\
nor in sensual pleasure,\
gross or refined.\
But in the extinction of craving\
is joy to be found\
by a disciple of the Buddha.

188-189.\
To many places beings withdraw\
to escape from fear:\
to mountains, forests,\
parklands and gardens;\
sacred places as well.\
But none of these places\
offer true refuge,\
none of them can free us from fear.

190-191.\
One who finds refuge in the Buddha\
in the Dhamma and in the Sangha\
sees with penetrating insight\
suffering, its cause, its release\
and the Way leading to true freedom.

192.\
The Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha:\
these are the true refuge;\
these are supreme;\
these lead to Liberation.

193.\
It is hard to find\
a being of great wisdom;\
rare are the places\
in which they are born.\
Those who surround them\
when they appear\
know good fortune indeed.

194.\
Blessed is the arising of a Buddha;\
blessed is the revealing of the Dhamma;\
blessed is the concord of the Sangha;\
delightful is harmonious communion.

195-196.\
Immeasurable is the benefit\
obtained from honouring those\
who are pure and beyond fear.\
Beings who have found freedom\
from sorrow and grieving\
are worthy of honour.

15. Happiness
=============

197.\
While in the midst\
of those who hate,\
to dwell free from hating\
is happiness indeed.

198.\
While in the midst\
of those who are troubled,\
to dwell free from trouble\
is happiness indeed.

199.\
While in the midst\
of those who are greedy,\
to dwell free from greed\
is happiness indeed.

200.\
We dwell happily,\
free from anxiety;\
like radiant beings\
in celestial realms\
we rejoice in delight.

201.\
Victory leads to hatred,\
for the defeated suffer.\
The peaceful live happily,\
beyond victory and defeat.

202.\
There is no fire like lust,\
no distress like hatred,\
no pain like the burden of attachment,\
no joy like the peace of liberation.

203.\
Hunger is the greatest affliction,\
conditionality the greatest\
source of despair.\
The wise, seeing this as it is,\
realize liberation, the greatest joy.

204.\
A healthy mind is the greatest gain.\
Contentment is the greatest wealth.\
Trustworthiness is the best of kin.\
Unconditional freedom is the highest bliss.

205.\
Tasting the flavour of solitude\
and the nectar of peace,\
those who drink the joy\
that is the essence of reality\
abide free from fear of evil.

206.\
It is always a pleasure\
not to have to encounter fools.\
It is always good to see noble beings,\
and a delight to live with them.

207.\
Tedious is the company of fools,\
always painful, like being\
surrounded by enemies;\
but to associate with the wise\
is like being at home.

208.\
You should follow the ways\
of those who are steadfast,\
discerning, pure and aware,\
just as the moon follows\
the path of the stars.

16. Affection
=============

209.\
There are those who pursue\
that which should be avoided\
and avoid that which\
should be pursued.\
Caught up in the senses\
they lose their way,\
and later envy\
those who know the truth.

210.\
To lose the company\
of those with whom\
one feels at home is painful,\
to be associated with those\
whom you dislike is even worse;\
so do not abandon yourselves\
either to the company of those\
with whom you feel at home\
or those whom you dislike.

211.\
Beware of the attachment\
that springs from fondness,\
for separation from those\
one holds dear is painful,\
while if you take sides\
neither for nor against fondness,\
there will be no ties that bind.

212.\
From endearment springs grief.\
From endearment springs fear of loss.\
Yet, if one is free from endearment\
there is no grief\
so how could there be fear?

213.\
Becoming lost in affection\
brings sorrow;\
becoming lost in affection\
brings fear.\
Being free from affection\
means sorrow ceases,\
so how could there be any fear?

214.\
Becoming lost in enjoyment\
brings sorrow;\
becoming lost in enjoyment\
brings fear.\
Being free in your experience of enjoyment\
means sorrow ceases,\
so how could there be any fear?

215.\
Becoming lost in lust\
brings sorrow;\
becoming lost in lust\
brings fear.\
Not being lost in lust\
means sorrow ceases,\
so how could there be any fear?

216.\
Becoming lost in craving\
brings sorrow;\
becoming lost in craving\
brings fear.\
Being free from craving\
means sorrow ceases,\
so how could there be any fear?

217.\
Naturally held dear are those\
who live with right action\
and have found the Way,\
and through insight\
have become established in the truth.

218.\
Those who long\
for the undefinable,\
with hearts filled with inspiration,\
whose minds are freed\
from sensual longing,\
are called\
“those bound for freedom”.

219-220.\
Just as family and friends\
joyfully welcome home\
loved ones returned from afar,\
so their own good deeds\
welcome those who have done them\
as they go from this life to the next.

17. Anger
=========

221.\
Relinquish anger.\
Let go of conceit.\
Release yourself\
from all that binds you.\
The pure-hearted who cling\
neither to body nor mind\
do not fall prey to suffering.

222.\
I say that those who contain anger\
as a charioteer controls\
a speeding chariot\
are fully in charge of their lives;\
others are merely keeping\
their hands on the reins.

223.\
Transform anger with kindness\
and badness with that which is good,\
meanness with generosity\
and deceit with integrity.

224.\
These three ways\
lead to the heavens:\
asserting the truth,\
not yielding to anger,\
and giving, even if you have\
only a little to share.

225.\
Awakened Ones do not cause harm.\
They are rightly restrained\
and they move to changelessness\
where they grieve no more.

226.\
All pollution is cleared\
from the minds of those\
who are always vigilant,\
training themselves day and night,\
and whose lives are fully intent\
upon liberation.

227.\
Since ancient times it has been the case\
that those who speak too much are criticized,\
as are those who speak too little\
and those who don’t speak at all.\
Everyone in this world is criticized.

228.\
There never was,\
nor will there be,\
nor is there now, anybody\
who is only blamed\
or wholly praised.

229.\
Those who live impeccably,\
who are discerning,\
intelligent and virtuous –\
they are continually praised by the wise.

230.\
Who would cast blame on those\
who in their being are like gold?\
Even the gods praise them.

231.\
Beware of clumsy movement\
and be aware in your bodily conduct.\
Renounce all devious action\
and cultivate that which is wholesome.

232.\
Beware of contrived utterance\
and be aware in all that you say.\
Renounce all cunning speech\
and cultivate that which is wholesome.

233.\
Beware of devious thinking\
and be aware of all that you dwell upon.\
Renounce all unruly thought\
and cultivate that which is wholesome.

234.\
Ably self-restrained\
are the wise,\
in action, in thought\
and in speech.

18. Pollution
=============

235.\
Resembling a withered leaf,\
you have the messenger\
of death at your side.\
Although a long journey lies ahead,\
you have still made no provision.

236.\
Hasten to cultivate wisdom;\
make an island for yourself.\
Freed from stain and defilement,\
you will enter noble being.

237.\
It is time for you to come\
into the presence of the Lord of Death.\
There is no time for rest on this journey,\
yet what provision have you made?

238.\
Hasten to cultivate wisdom;\
make an island for yourself.\
Freed from stain and defilement,\
you are released from birth and death.

239.\
Gradually, gradually,\
a moment at a time,\
the wise remove their own impurities\
as a goldsmith removes the dross.

240.\
As iron is destroyed by the rust it produces,\
so those who perform evil are corroded\
by their own action.

241.\
Lack of study leads\
to forgetting the teachings;\
neglect spoils the home;\
laziness leads to loss of beauty;\
heedlessness ruins attention.

242.\
Sexual misconduct\
diminishes those who perform it;\
stinginess diminishes\
those who could give.\
Acts that diminish their doer\
are stains indeed.

243.\
But the worst stain of all\
is ignorance.\
Be purified of this\
and you are free.

244.\
Life is apparently easy\
for one who lacks shame,\
who is as impudent as a crow,\
who is arrogant, aggressive,\
intrusive and corrupt.

245.\
Life is not easy for those\
who have a sense of shame,\
who are modest,\
pure-minded and detached,\
morally upright and reflective.

246-247.\
Whoever destroys life,\
disregards truth,\
is sexually irresponsible,\
takes what is not rightfully theirs,\
and heedlessly indulges in drugs\
destroys the very roots\
of their own life.

248.\
Whoever is intent on goodness\
should know this:\
a lack of self-restraint is disastrous.\
Do not allow greed and misconduct\
to prolong your misery.

249-250.\
People are inspired to be generous\
according to their faith and trust.\
If we become discontented\
with what we have been given,\
our meditation will be filled\
with endless mental affliction;\
but if we are free from this discontent,\
our meditation is full of peace.

251.\
There is no fire like lust,\
no obstruction like hatred,\
no trap like delusion,\
and no vortex like craving.

252.\
It is easy to see the faults of others,\
but it takes courage to look at one’s own.\
As with chaff,\
one might winnow others’ shortcomings\
while hiding one’s own;\
as a stealthy hunter\
might conceal himself from his prey.

253.\
Those who always look for\
the faults of others –\
their corruptions increase\
and they are far from freedom.

254.\
No tracks are found in the air,\
there is no liberation apart from the Way.\
Most people tend to indulge in proliferation,\
from which Awakened Ones are free.

255.\
No tracks are found in the air,\
there is no liberation apart from the Way.\
There are no conditioned things\
that are permanent,\
and yet the Buddhas remain unperturbed.

19. The Just
============

256.\
Making an arbitrary decision\
does not amount to justice.\
The wise decide the case\
after considering arguments\
for and against.

257.\
By making decisions\
based on truth and fairness\
one safeguards the law\
and is called righteous.

258.\
Those who speak much\
are not necessarily possessed of wisdom.\
The wise can be seen\
to be at peace with life\
and free from all enmity and fear.

259.\
Though one’s knowledge\
may be limited,\
if understanding and conduct\
rightly accord with the Way,\
one is to be considered\
well-versed in Dhamma.

260.\
Having grey hair\
does not make you an elder;\
ripe in years maybe,\
but perhaps pointlessly so.

261.\
One who is truthful,\
virtuous, impeccable in conduct,\
free from all stains and wise\
can be called an elder.

262 -263.\
Those who are envious,\
stingy and manipulative\
remain unappealing despite\
good looks and eloquent speech.\
But those who have freed themselves\
from their faults\
and arrived at wisdom\
are attractive indeed.

264.\
Shaving your head\
does not make you a renunciate\
if you are still full of\
recklessness and deceit.\
How could someone possessed\
by craving and lust\
be considered a renunciate?

265.\
You become a monk or nun\
by letting go of all evil,\
by renouncing all\
unwholesomeness,\
both great and small.

266.\
You are not a monk or nun\
because you depend\
on others for food,\
but by submitting yourself\
wholeheartedly\
to the training of body,\
speech and mind.

267.\
You become a monk or nun\
by seeing through this world\
with understanding,\
by rising above good and bad\
and living a life of purity\
and contemplation.

268-269.\
Silence does not denote profundity\
if you are ignorant and untrained.\
Like one holding scales\
a sage weighs things up,\
wholesome and unwholesome,\
and comes to know\
both the inner and outer worlds.\
Therefore the sage is called wise.

270.\
Those who still cause harm\
to living beings\
cannot be considered as attained.\
Those who are attained\
maintain a harmless demeanour\
towards all beings.

271-272.\
Do not rest contented\
because you keep all the rules and regulations,\
nor because you achieve great learning.\
Do not feel satisfied because you\
attain meditative absorption,\
nor because you can dwell in\
the bliss of solitude.\
Only when you arrive\
at the complete eradication\
of all ignorance and conceit\
should you be content.

20. The Path
============

273.\
The Eightfold Path\
is the most honourable way,\
the Four Noble Truths\
the most honourable utterance,\
freedom from craving\
the most honourable state,\
and the all-seeing Buddha\
the most honourable being.

274.\
This is the only Way;\
there is no other\
that leads to clear seeing.\
Follow this Way\
and Mara becomes disoriented.

275.\
If you walk the path\
you will arrive at the end of suffering.\
Having beheld this myself,\
I proclaim the Way\
which removes all thorns.

276.\
The Awakened Ones\
can but point the way;\
we must make the effort ourselves.\
Those who reflect wisely\
and enter the path are freed\
from the fetters of Mara.

277.\
“All conditioned things\
are impermanent”;\
when we see this with insight\
we will tire of this life of suffering.\
This is the Way to purification.

278.\
“All conditioned things\
are inherently lacking”;\
when we see this with insight\
we will tire of this life of suffering.\
This is the Way to purification.

279.\
“All realities are devoid\
of an abiding self”;\
when we see this with insight\
we will tire of this life of suffering.\
This is the Way to purification.

280.\
If, while still young and strong,\
you procrastinate\
when you should act,\
indulging in heedless fantasies,\
the Way and its wisdom\
will never become clear.

281.\
Be careful in what you say,\
restrained in what you think,\
and impeccable in how you act.\
Purifying these three ways of behaviour\
will take you along the Way of the sages.

282.\
To contemplate life leads to wisdom;\
without contemplation wisdom wanes.\
Recognize how wisdom\
is cultivated and destroyed,\
and walk the Way of increase.

283.\
Clear away the forests of craving,\
but do not attack and destroy the trees.\
Clear the entire forest of craving\
and you will see the Way to freedom.

284.\
So long as sexual attraction\
has not been cleared away,\
if even the slightest trace remains,\
the heart is held in dependence\
like a suckling calf to a cow.

285.\
Remove the bonds of affection\
as one might pluck an autumn flower.\
Walk the Way that leads to liberation,\
explained by the Awakened One.

286.\
It is a fool\
who indulges in dreaming\
about the most comfortable\
place to live, saying,\
“Here it will be warm,\
there it will be cool” –\
unaware of impending death.

287.\
As a flood could sweep away\
an entire village,\
those who are caught up\
in relationships and possessions\
will be carried away by death.

288-289.\
As you approach death\
none of your fond attachments\
will protect you.\
See this, then with wise restraint\
and unwavering effort,\
hasten to clear your path to liberation.

21. Various
===========

290.\
It is wisdom\
that enables letting go\
of a lesser happiness\
in pursuit of a happiness\
which is greater.

291.\
You fail\
in the pursuit of happiness\
if it is at the expense\
of others’ well-being.\
The snare of ill-will\
can still entangle you.

292.\
To leave undone\
that which should be done\
and to do that\
which should be avoided\
leads to carelessness and conceit.\
It will increase confusion.

293.\
Confusion ceases\
by maintaining\
a meditation practice\
focused in the body,\
by avoiding that\
which should not be done\
and by mindfully doing\
that which should be done.

294.\
By removing craving and conceit,\
eradicating wrong views,\
and overcoming\
the deluded attachments of the sense realm,\
the noble being moves freely on.

295.\
Having cleared\
all the hindrances to the Path –\
greed, rage, dullness and laziness,\
worry, anxiety and doubt –\
the noble being freely moves on.

296.\
Disciples of the Buddha\
are fully awake,\
dwelling both day and night\
in contemplation of the Awakened One.

297.\
Disciples of the Buddha\
are fully awake,\
dwelling both day and night\
in contemplation of reality.

298.\
Disciples of the Buddha\
are fully awake,\
dwelling both day and night\
in contemplation of the communion\
of beings who have awakened.

299.\
Disciples of the Buddha\
are fully awake,\
dwelling both day and night\
in contemplation of\
the true nature of the body.

300.\
Disciples of the Buddha\
are fully awake\
both day and night,\
taking delight in compassion.

301.\
Disciples of the Buddha\
are fully awake\
both day and night,\
taking delight\
in cultivating the heart.

302.\
It is hard to live\
the life of renunciation;\
its challenges\
are difficult to find pleasant.\
Yet it is also hard to live\
the householder’s life;\
there is pain\
when associating with those\
among whom one feels no companionship.\
To wander uncommitted\
is always going to be difficult;\
why not renounce\
the deluded pursuit of pain?

303.\
A traveller possessed of virtue,\
disciplined and committed to right conduct,\
will be received with honour;\
such a one can be recognized\
and can travel with confidence.

304.\
The good\
are seen even from afar.\
They shine like the distant\
Himalayan peaks.\
The untrained simply disappear\
like arrows shot into the dark.

305.\
With enthusiasm establish yourself\
in solitary practice –\
sit alone, sleep alone, walk alone\
and delight as if secluded in the forest.

22. Hell
========

306.\
Lying leads to sorrow.\
Concealing wrong actions\
leads to sorrow.\
These two acts of deceit\
take beings\
to the same state of woe.

307.\
Those who wear\
the robes of a renunciate,\
yet harbour evil\
and are unrestrained,\
go to a sorrowful state.

308.\
It would be better for a renunciate\
to swallow molten iron\
than to live on offerings\
deceitfully gained.

309.\
Accumulated sadness,\
troubled sleep,\
blame and remorse\
are an adulterer’s lot.

310.\
Brief is the delight\
of the fearful adulterous couple,\
for only painful consequences can follow.

311.\
As *kusa* grass wrongly grasped\
wounds the hand that holds it,\
so the renunciate life\
hurts those who train in it wrongly.

312.\
Acts carelessly done,\
practices corruptly performed,\
the holy life lived perversely,\
lead to little or no benefit at all.

313.\
If anything is to be done,\
do it well,\
with energy and devotion;\
the renunciate life led heedlessly\
just stirs up the dust.

314.\
Hurtful deeds\
are better left undone\
as they always lead to remorse.\
Harmless deeds are better done\
as no regret will follow.

315.\
As a border city must be carefully protected,\
so guard yourself both within and without;\
build your defences wisely and in time.\
If these things are not attended to\
at the right moment,\
great sadness will come.

316.\
Distorted views\
which create feelings of shame\
about that which is not shameful,\
or indifference\
to that which is shameful,\
can cause beings to descend into hell.

317.\
Distorted views\
which create feelings of fear\
towards what is not actually threatening,\
or indifference in the face\
of that which is threatening,\
can cause beings to descend into hell.

318.\
Distorted views,\
which give rise to seeing right as wrong\
and wrong as right\
cause beings to disintegrate.

319.\
The clear seeing which knows\
that which is flawed as flawed\
and that which is pure as pure\
can lead beings to transcend misery.

23. The Elephant
================

320.\
As an elephant in battle\
withstands arrows,\
I choose to endure\
verbal attacks from others.

321.\
Well-trained horses\
can be trusted in crowds,\
and are to be mounted by kings.\
Individuals who have trained\
themselves to withstand abuse\
will be valuable everywhere.

322.\
Impressive are horses or elephants\
which have been well-trained;\
but more impressive\
are individuals\
who have tamed themselves.

323.\
It is not on a well-trained animal\
that you can ride\
to the land of liberation;\
it is only on the vehicle\
of a well-trained self\
that you will arrive there.

324.\
When captured and bound and in rut,\
a wild elephant is restless, uncontrollable,\
not eating its food.\
It longs for its native forest home.

325.\
It is a fool who overeats\
and indulges in laziness,\
then, feeling drowsy,\
wallows in sleep like an oversized pig;\
this forebodes perpetual suffering.

326.\
My mind which was once\
wild and unruly,\
wandering as it wished,\
I hold now in check\
as the mahout with his hook\
controls an elephant in rut.

327.\
As an elephant\
resolutely drags itself from a swamp,\
uplift yourself with the inspiration\
of cultivated attention.

328.\
If you find a good companion,\
of integrity and wisdom,\
you will overcome all dangers\
in joyous and caring company.

329.\
But if you cannot find\
a good companion\
of integrity and wisdom,\
then, like a king departing\
a conquered land,\
or an elephant wandering\
alone in the forest,\
walk alone.

330.\
A harmless solitary life\
lived at ease,\
like that of the lone elephant in the forest,\
is better than\
the unnecessary company of fools.

331.\
The timely company of friends is goodness.\
Fewness of needs is goodness.\
Having accumulated virtue\
at life’s end is goodness.\
Having dispensed\
with all suffering is goodness.

332.\
Rightly serving one’s parents is goodness.\
Supporting renunciates is goodness.\
Honouring awakened beings is goodness.

333.\
Sustaining virtue into old age is goodness.\
Sustaining sound faith is goodness.\
The arising of insight is goodness.\
Renouncing evil is goodness.

24. Craving
===========

334.\
Uncontained craving\
grows like a creeper in the forest.\
Being lost in it,\
one leaps around\
like a tree-dwelling ape looking for fruit.

335.\
Fostering habits\
such as craving and clinging\
is like fertilizing noxious weeds.

336.\
As water falls from a lotus leaf,\
so sorrow drops from those\
who are free of toxic craving.

337.\
Torrential rains can destroy crops.\
Mara can destroy you.\
Thus I implore you –\
dig up the roots of all craving.\
I give you my blessing\
for this work.

338.\
If the roots are not removed,\
a tree grows again and again;\
suffering returns to us\
so long as craving remains.

339.\
When the streams\
of sensual pleasure run strong\
they can generate\
a torrent of longing.

340.\
The streams of craving flow everywhere.\
The wild creeper of craving\
spreads and entangles.\
Discerning this creeper with insight,\
dig it out.

341.\
Beings naturally experience pleasure;\
but when pleasure is\
contaminated with craving,\
not releasing it creates frustration\
and tedious suffering follows.

342.\
Trapped in habits of craving,\
people panic\
like rabbits caught in a snare.\
Their reactions reinforce the pain\
of their entrapment.

343.\
Trapped in habits of craving,\
people panic\
like rabbits caught in a snare.\
If you wish to be free from entrapment,\
craving itself must be removed.

344.\
There are those who have begun\
on the path to freedom,\
yet out of desire return to being chained.

345-346.\
Wisdom sees\
that being held behind bars\
or bound by chains\
is less limiting\
than infatuation with possessions\
and obsession with relationships.\
These bonds, though not so obvious,\
are strong and hold us down.\
To renounce attachment\
to the world of the senses\
is to be free from the prison of craving.

347.\
Like a spider caught in its own web,\
a being enwrapped in sensual craving\
must be released from its own longings\
before it can walk free.

348.\
Let go of the past.\
Let go of the future.\
Let go of the present.\
With a heart that is free,\
cross over to that shore\
which is beyond suffering.

349.\
The bonds\
of deluded habits and craving\
are strengthened\
by one who lets the mind heedlessly dwell\
on objects of desire.

350.\
But one who delights\
in calming sensual thoughts,\
who is alert\
and cultivates awareness\
of the loathsome\
aspects of the body,\
breaks through craving\
and unbinds deluded habits.

351.\
No more need is there to re-form\
for those who have reached the goal;\
they are free from fear and longing.\
The thorns of existence have been removed.

352.\
A master is one who has let go\
of all craving and clinging to the world;\
who has seen\
the truth beyond forms,\
yet is possessed of\
a profound knowledge of words.\
Such a great being can be said\
to have finished the task.

353.\
I do not declare another as my teacher,\
since by myself have I arrived\
at the wisdom that overcomes all,\
realizes all, renounces all.\
Wholly liberated am I from all craving.

354.\
The gift of truth excels all gifts.\
The flavour of reality\
surpasses all flavours.\
The delight of truth\
transcends all delights.\
Freedom from craving\
is the end of all suffering.

355.\
Riches mostly ruin the foolish,\
but not those who seek the beyond.\
Just as they dismiss\
the well-being of others and cause harm,\
fools also ruin themselves.

356.\
Weeds cause damage in fields.\
Lust causes damage to all beings.\
Support those who are free from lust;\
the gift will yield great benefit.

357.\
Weeds cause damage in fields.\
Hatred causes damage to all beings.\
Support those who are free from hatred;\
the gift will yield great benefit.

358.\
Weeds cause damage in fields.\
Confusion causes damage to all beings.\
Support those who are free from confusion;\
the gift will yield great benefit.

359.\
Weeds cause damage in fields.\
Envy causes damage to all beings.\
Encourage those who are free from envy\
and there will be great benefit.

25. The Renunciate
==================

360.\
It is good to restrain the eye.\
It is good to restrain the ear.\
It is good to restrain the nose.\
It is good to restrain the tongue.

361.\
It is good to be restrained in body.\
It is good to be restrained in speech.\
It is good to be restrained in mind.\
It is good to be restrained in everything.\
The renunciate who is restrained\
in every way will realize\
freedom from suffering.

362.\
One who is rightly disciplined\
in all actions,\
who is composed,\
contented and delights in\
solitary contemplation –\
such is a renunciate.

363.\
It is pleasing to hear\
the words of a renunciate\
who is wise, not inflated,\
whose mind is composed\
and whose speech is contained\
and clear in meaning.

364.\
One who abides in Dhamma,\
who delights in Dhamma,\
who contemplates Dhamma,\
who memorizes Dhamma\
does not lose the Way.

365.\
Bemoaning your own lot\
or envying the gains of others\
obstructs peace of mind.

366.\
But being contented\
even with modest gains,\
pure in livelihood and energetic,\
you will be held in high esteem.

367.\
True renunciates\
regard the entire body-mind\
without any thought of ’I’ or ’mine’\
and are devoid of longing\
for what they do not have.

368.\
A renunciate who\
abides in loving-kindness,\
with a heart full of devotion\
for the Buddha’s teaching,\
will find peace, stillness and bliss.

369.\
Bale out the water from your boat;\
cut loose from the defiling passions\
of lust and hatred;\
unencumbered, sail on\
towards liberation.

370.\
One who has\
cut off coarse attachments,\
cut off subtle attachments,\
who cultivates the spiritual faculties,\
is the one who finds freedom\
from delusion.

371.\
Be careful!\
Do not neglect meditation,\
nor allow the mind\
to dwell on sensuality\
lest you might heedlessly swallow\
a red-hot ball of iron\
and find yourself crying out,\
“Why am I suffering?”

372.\
Concentration does not arise\
without understanding,\
nor understanding\
without concentration.\
One who knows both\
approaches liberation.

373.\
A happiness transcending ordinary bliss\
is experienced by those renunciates\
who have entered into seclusion\
with tranquil heart\
and clear understanding of the Way.

374.\
When those who are wise\
dwell in contemplation\
on the transient nature\
of the body-mind\
and of all conditioned existence,\
they experience joy and delight,\
seeing through\
to the inherently secure.

375-376.\
This, then, is the beginning\
for a renunciate who takes up the training:\
wisely control your faculties,\
commit yourself to the instruction,\
seek contentment;\
cultivate the company of those\
who support your aspiration\
for energetic practice of the teachings.\
The beauty of pure conduct\
conditions whole-hearted well-being,\
giving rise to complete\
freedom from remorse.

377.\
As old flowers fall\
from a jasmine plant,\
let lust and hatred\
fall away.

378.\
I call them the peaceful ones,\
who are calm in body,\
in speech and in mind,\
and who are thoroughly purged\
of all worldly obsessions.

379.\
Scrutinize yourself.\
Examine yourself.\
With right attention\
to self-assessment\
you will live at ease.

380.\
We are our own protection;\
we are indeed our own secure abiding;\
how could it be otherwise?\
So with due care\
we attend to ourselves.

381.\
A monk, a nun, who cultivates\
a joyous disposition\
and is filled with\
confidence in the Way\
will find peace, stillness and bliss.

382.\
While still a youth, a renunciate\
fully devoted to the Way\
lights up the world\
like the moon emerging from clouds.

26. Great Being
===============

383.\
Diligently cut off\
the stream of craving\
and abandon sensual longings;\
knowing the inherent limitations\
of all that is formed,\
realize the uncreated.

384.\
All chains of confinement fall away\
from those who see clearly\
beyond the two.

385.\
I say a being is great\
who stands not on this shore,\
nor the other shore,\
nor on any shore at all.\
Such a being is free from all ties.

386.\
I say a being is great\
who dwells secluded and at ease,\
knowing the heart\
free from all pollution,\
having completed the task,\
purified of all compulsive tendencies\
and awake.

387.\
The sun shines by day,\
the moon shines by night.\
But both all day and all night\
the Buddha shines\
in glorious splendour.

388.\
Having transformed evil,\
one is called a great being.\
Living peacefully,\
one is called a contemplative.\
Having given up impurity,\
one is called a renunciate.

389.\
Non-retaliation\
is the characteristic of great beings.\
They do not give rise to anger.\
Should they be attacked,\
it is not in their nature to strike back.

390.\
Suffering subsides to the degree\
that you are free from the intention\
to cause harm.\
There is no real greatness\
if there is no restraint of anger.

391.\
One who refrains from causing harm\
by way of body, speech or mind,\
can be called a worthy being.

392.\
Devotion and respect\
should be offered to those\
who have shown us the Way.

393.\
One should not be considered\
worthy of respect\
because of birth or background,\
or any outer sign;\
it is purity\
and the realization of truth\
that determine one’s worth.

394.\
Your outer adornments\
and pseudo-spiritual preoccupations\
are irrelevant\
if inwardly you remain in disarray.

395.\
To be unconcerned\
about outer appearance\
but committed to\
intense relentless practice\
makes for greatness.

396.\
No one is noble\
merely because of what they inherit.\
Nobility comes from cleansing oneself\
of all pollutions\
and attachments.

397.\
Whoever has cut all that tethers\
and found fearlessness,\
who is beyond attachments\
and defilements,\
I recognize as a great being.

398.\
Whoever severs the ties of hatred,\
unbinds the ropes of craving,\
undoes the locks of wrong view,\
opens the doors of ignorance\
and sees truth,\
I recognize as a great being.

399.\
Strength of patience\
is the might of noble beings;\
they can be shackled,\
endure verbal abuse and beatings,\
without resorting to anger.

400.\
Those who are free from anger,\
simply disciplined, virtuous,\
well-trained\
and have gone beyond rebirth,\
these I call great beings.

401.\
As water slides from a lotus leaf,\
so sensual pleasures\
do not cling\
to a great being.

402.\
Those who know the freedom\
of having laid aside\
the burden of attachment\
to the body-mind\
I call great beings.

403.\
Those possessed of deep wisdom,\
who see what accords with the Way\
and what does not,\
those who have attained\
to the peak of possibility,\
I call great beings.

404.\
Those who are free from attachment\
to the company of either householders\
or fellow renunciates,\
and so wander free from desires\
or concern for security of any kind,\
are great beings.

405.\
Those who have renounced\
the use of force\
in relationship to other beings,\
whether weak or strong,\
who neither kill\
nor cause to be killed,\
can be called great beings.

406.\
Those who remain\
friendly amid the hostile,\
at peace among the aggressive,\
and who do not attach themselves\
to that upon which others depend\
are great beings.

407.\
For a great being,\
lust and ill-will,\
arrogance and conceit\
drop away,\
even as a tiny seed would drop\
from the tip of a needle.

408.\
Those who speak truth\
and give gentle encouragement,\
contending with no-one,\
these do I call great beings.

409.\
The actions of a great being are pure.\
Great beings never\
knowingly take for themselves\
that which belongs to another.

410.\
The heart of a great being is free.\
Great beings no longer pine\
for things of this world\
or any other world.

411.\
The heart of a great being is free.\
With accurate understanding\
which is beyond doubt,\
great beings have set their feet firmly\
in the land of liberation.

412.\
Whoever has transcended\
all ties of good and bad,\
is purified\
and free from sorrow,\
should be called a great being.

413.\
Those beings who\
are released from all longing\
and, like the moon in a cloudless sky,\
are pure, clear and serene,\
I call great.

414.\
There are beings\
who travel the difficult path\
across the dangerous swamp\
of defiling passions,\
traverse the ocean of delusion,\
through the darkness of ignorance,\
and go beyond.\
They are sustained\
by wise contemplation,\
secure in freedom from doubt,\
liberated;\
such beings are great indeed.

415.\
It is a great being\
who, having restrained desires\
for sensual pleasure,\
lives the homeless life\
and realizes freedom\
from both sensual desire\
and perpetual becoming.

416.\
It is a great being\
who, having restrained all craving,\
lives the homeless life\
and realizes freedom\
from both craving\
and perpetual becoming.

417.\
It is a great being\
who can see through all obvious delights\
as well as subtle pleasures,\
to be free from attachment.

418.\
One who has ceased\
from following like and dislike,\
who is cooled,\
who is not swayed\
by worldly conditions –\
I call a great being.

419.\
I say anyone who understands fully\
the passing away and arising of beings,\
who remains aware,\
non-attached, awake,\
who is conscious of\
right action at all times,\
is a great being.

420.\
The condition after death\
of great beings is indiscernible;\
no trace of passion remains.\
They are pure.

421.\
Anyone who lives freed\
from habits of clinging\
to past, present or future,\
attaching to nothing,\
is a great being.

422.\
A great being is fearless like a bull,\
noble, strong, wise, diligent,\
sees through delusions,\
is clear, attentive and awake.

423.\
To understand all dimensions\
of past existence,\
to see accurately into all realms,\
to reach the end of rebirths,\
to know with insight\
that which must be known,\
to free the heart from ignorance –\
this is truly being made great.

A Note on the Text
==================

*A Dhammapada for Contemplation* is a contemporary rendering of an
ancient text; but what of the original Dhammapada? The Buddha lived and
taught in India two and a half millennia ago. He wrote nothing, and his
teachings were memorised and passed on orally by his earliest followers.
An enormous body of material was preserved in this way, although
different versions arose in the various Buddhist schools, which
flourished in India after the Buddha’s *parinibbana*. The collection of
verses known as the Dhammapada was composed, probably sometime in the
3rd century BCE, in a language now known as Pali, by members of the
‘Theravada’, or ‘School of the Elders’. We know of three other versions,
written down later in other Indian languages, but they survive only
partially, or as fragments rescued from archaeological finds, or as
translations in Tibetan and Chinese. Those other versions mostly contain
the same material, but there are many variations.

What we may think of as ‘the’ Dhammapada, then, is one version—the
shortest and probably the earliest one—of a work with a lively history.
It was taken to Sri Lanka later in the 3rd century BCE by the
Theravadins, in its original Indian language, and written down along
with the rest of the Pali canon in the 1st century BCE; it comes down to
us today as preserved and commented upon by the Theravada tradition. It
was the first Buddhist text to be printed in Europe, in 1855, along with
a Latin translation, and has been translated into English at least 30
times. It is without doubt the best-known early Buddhist scripture, and
to this day Sri Lankan monks will memorise it before their ordinations.

The reason for this popularity is not hard to discover. The Dhammapada
is essentially a compilation of sayings, pithy, poetic and direct, that
speak to all, not just to monk or nun or scholar. About half of them are
found in other parts of the Pali canon, and although they are roughly
grouped into chapters sharing a particular theme, most seem to have been
chosen for their individual qualities, as sayings and sequences of
sayings rich in wisdom to be savoured. Many of the sayings are concerned
with ethics, with what is good and foolish and in what each results.
Some of these are not, in fact, especially Buddhist, but are found also
in other Indian religious texts, such as the great epic, the
*Mahabharata*. That is, they belong to a wider tradition of wisdom, of
which we have our own versions in the west.

Beyond this basic human wisdom, however, the sayings of the Dhammapada
concern the Way to “freedom from all limitation: liberation, true
security” (verse 23), which is the particular teaching of the Buddha.
They do not present this teaching in the form of doctrine, but instead
offer a myriad hints, approaches and directions of investigation, from
descriptions of the “great beings” (chapter 23) who have reached the
other shore of existence, to compelling comparisons of the paths of
“appreciative awareness” and “heedlessness” (verse 21). The appeal of
the Dhammapada is greatly enhanced, however, by the similes, metaphors
and poetic images lavishly employed to illustrate the meaning of the
sayings; for instance, the influence of the wise is described as a light
“like that of the moon emerging from clouds” (verse 172). For good
measure, the Dhammapada also includes the Buddha’s ‘Song of Victory’,
the poem he uttered, it is said, just after he had gained enlightenment
(verses 153-4).

The sayings and poems of the Dhammapada were written in verse consisting
of four- and six-line stanzas, with lines of eight or eleven syllables.
Such forms belong to ancient Indian literary tradition, and lend to the
text a distinctive rhythm. This rhythmic constraint necessitated the
finding of words of the right number of syllables to fit the lines; the
effect of which is a multiplicity and vigour in the language not found
in the prose scriptures. There is therefore a formality in the Pali
verse, which, like most poetry, is untranslatable. If we add to this
untranslatability the demands of reproducing in English the epigrammatic
and suggestive quality of the sayings, it is clear that a formally
definitive translation of the Dhammapada is going to be difficult. For
this reason, it is necessary to read the text in different translations,
comparing the different emphases and resonances found in each, to come
to a clear appreciation of the truth offered in each verse.

We could view the sayings of the Dhammapada as photographic negatives,
as very old artefacts that miraculously contain within them the profound
utterances of the Buddha. Such negatives can be used to make prints, in
a modern language like English, which reproduce those ancient sayings.
The attempts of scholarly translators to provide strictly objective,
formally accurate prints from those old negatives is worthy and
necessary, but the objective method does not necessarily transmit all
that it was hoped would be captured by the original photographs, those
few words of verse. Ajahn Munindo, in his rendering of the text, offers
a more personal printing from each negative; one that is designed to
transmit, not the objective meaning of each saying, but something
relevant and useful for a person in search of wisdom today.

His method was this: using several respected translations, he
ascertained what to his mind was the spirit or essence of each saying.
This he did with the aid of the traditional story associated with each
verse, which gives an account of the occasion and significance of its
utterance. These stories were without doubt composed later than the text
itself, and have in general a legendary character like that of the
*Jataka* tales, but nevertheless create an ambience, a mythic context,
which gives access to an important dimension of what each saying means.
Having thus ascertained the spirit of each verse, he sought an
expression in contemporary language, which might transmit effectively
its spiritual impulse.

Being an ancient Indian text, the Dhammapada abounds in references to
monsoons, elephants, jungles, villages, brahmins and so on. While this
is wonderfully evocative of life in the Buddha’s time, it distracts our
attention from the point of the sayings; and therefore Ajahn Munindo’s
version is, on the whole, rendered into a contemporary idiom relevant to
the modern worldview. The *birana* grass that grows fast after monsoon
rains, for instance, is reinterpreted as weeds fed with fertiliser
(verse 335), and the Indian ascetic’s matted hair, his antelope skin and
his lifestyle are rendered as “outer adornments and pseudo-spiritual
preoccupations” (verse 394). Most references to rebirth, and to the hell
and heaven realms of Buddhist cosmology, have been replaced by
psychological renderings of more relevance today. The references to the
wandering mendicant lifestyle of the Buddhist monastic sangha, dependent
as it was and is on a village-based agrarian culture, have been
modified.

There are other special features of Ajahn Munindo’s version. He has not
reproduced the gendered language of the original, so that his rendering
hopes to address all readers. He has ignored much of the word play that
is crucial to the original poetry, but at the benefit of much greater
fluidity and naturalness. Although no attempt has been made to reproduce
the formal qualities of the original, some of the beauty of the old
text’s poetry emerges through the freedom enabled by an interpretive
rendering (see, for instance, verse 377).
