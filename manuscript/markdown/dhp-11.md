Old Age
=======

146.\\
Why is there laughter?\\
Why is there joy\\
when the world is on fire?\\
Since you are clouded in darkness\\
should you not seek the light?

147.\\
Gaze upon this once-decorated body â€“\\
it used to attract attention\\
but now it is only festering flesh,\\
a putrid thing.\\
It is neither sure nor substantial.

148.\\
This body wears out with age;\\
it becomes a host to disease\\
- vulnerable, fragile,\\
a decrepit, disintegrating mass,\\
which eventually ends in death.

149.\\
What pleasure does life hold\\
once one has seen\\
old bleached bones\\
discarded and scattered round?

150.\\
The physical body consists of bones\\
covered with flesh and blood.\\
Stored up inside it\\
are decay and death, pride and malice.

151.\\
Passed down by the wise\\
is the knowledge that\\
though what is externally impressive\\
loses its splendour,\\
and though our bodies will decay,\\
the truth itself outlasts all degeneration.

152.\\
While ageing fools put on weight\\
like oxen in their stalls,\\
their minds remain small.

153-154.\\
For many lives I have wandered\\
looking for, but not finding,\\
the house-builder\\
who caused my suffering.\\
But now you are seen and\\
you shall build no more.\\
Your rafters are dislodged and\\
the ridge-pole is broken.\\
All craving is ended;\\
my heart is as one with the unmade.

155.\\
Those who while still young\\
neither choose a life of renunciation,\\
nor earn a good living,\\
end up like dejected old herons\\
beside a pond without fish.

156.\\
Those who while still young\\
neither choose a life of renunciation,\\
nor earn a good living,\\
will end up bemoaning the past,\\
falling like spent arrows\\
that have missed their mark.
