Awareness
=========

21.\\
Heedfulness leads to the Deathless;\\
heedlessness leads to death.\\
Those who are heedful are fully alive,\\
while those who are heedless\\
are as if already dead.

22.\\
The wise, being fully alive,\\
rejoice in heedfulness,\\
and abide delighting\\
in this ability.

23.\\
The Awakened Ones, firm in their resolve,\\
vigorously apply themselves,\\
and know freedom from all limitation:\\
liberation, true security.

24.\\
Those who are energetically\\
committed to the Way,\\
who are pure and considerate in effort,\\
composed and virtuous in conduct,\\
steadily increase in radiance.

25.\\
By endeavour, vigilance,\\
restraint and self-control,\\
let the wise make islands of themselves\\
which no flood can overwhelm.

26.\\
Those who are foolish and confused\\
betray themselves to heedlessness.\\
The wise treasure the awareness\\
they have cultivated\\
as their most precious possession.

27.\\
“Do not become lost in negligence,\\
do not become lost in sensuality.”\\
Heeding such counsel,\\
the contemplative discovers\\
profound release.

28.\\
Those Awakened Ones\\
who have tasted freedom\\
from all distraction\\
by cultivating awareness\\
view all who are suffering\\
with compassionate perspective,\\
as one on a mountain top\\
is able to view the plains.

29.\\
Aware among those who are heedless,\\
awake among those who sleep,\\
the wise go forward like strong young horses,\\
leaving the exhausted behind.

30.\\
By way of diligent awareness\\
the god Magha won his realm.\\
Diligence is ever rewarded,\\
negligence is ever scorned.

31.\\
The renunciate who delights in vigilance\\
and shuns heedlessness\\
advances like a grass fire,\\
consuming obstructions great and small.

32.\\
The renunciate who delights in vigilance\\
and shuns heedlessness\\
is protected from regression:\\
such a one approaches liberation.
