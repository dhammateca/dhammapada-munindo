The World
=========

167.\\
By renouncing unworthy ways\\
and by not living carelessly,\\
by not holding to false views,\\
we no longer perpetuate delusion.

168.\\
Do not show false humility.\\
Stand firmly in relation to your goal.\\
Practice, well-observed,\\
leads to contentment\\
both now and in the future.

169.\\
Live your life well in accord with the Way –\\
avoid a life of distraction.\\
A life well-lived leads to contentment\\
both now and in the future.

170.\\
The King of Death cannot find\\
those who look upon the world\\
as insubstantial,\\
as transient, a bubble –\\
illusive, only a mirage.

171.\\
Come, view this world.\\
See it as an ornate festive carriage.\\
See how fools are entranced by their visions,\\
yet for the wise there is no attachment.

172.\\
There are those\\
who awaken from heedlessness.\\
They bring light into the world\\
like the moon\\
emerging from clouds.

173.\\
One who transforms old and heedless ways\\
into fresh and wholesome acts\\
brings light into the world\\
like the moon freed from clouds.

174.\\
If birds are trapped in a net\\
only a few will ever escape.\\
In this world of illusion\\
only a few see their way to liberation.

175.\\
White swans rise into the air.\\
Adept yogis\\
transport themselves through space.\\
Wise beings\\
transcend worldly delusion\\
by outwitting the hordes of Mara.

176.\\
For one who transgresses\\
the law of truthfulness,\\
one who has no regard\\
for a future existence,\\
there is no manner of evil\\
that is impossible.

177.\\
Those who fail to value generosity\\
do not reach the celestial realms.\\
But the wise rejoice in giving\\
and forever abide in bliss.

178.\\
Better than ruling the whole world,\\
better than going to heaven,\\
better than lordship over the universe,\\
is an irreversible commitment to the Way.
