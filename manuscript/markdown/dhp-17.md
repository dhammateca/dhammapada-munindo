Anger
=====

221.\\
Relinquish anger.\\
Let go of conceit.\\
Release yourself\\
from all that binds you.\\
The pure-hearted who cling\\
neither to body nor mind\\
do not fall prey to suffering.

222.\\
I say that those who contain anger\\
as a charioteer controls\\
a speeding chariot\\
are fully in charge of their lives;\\
others are merely keeping\\
their hands on the reins.

223.\\
Transform anger with kindness\\
and badness with that which is good,\\
meanness with generosity\\
and deceit with integrity.

224.\\
These three ways\\
lead to the heavens:\\
asserting the truth,\\
not yielding to anger,\\
and giving, even if you have\\
only a little to share.

225.\\
Awakened Ones do not cause harm.\\
They are rightly restrained\\
and they move to changelessness\\
where they grieve no more.

226.\\
All pollution is cleared\\
from the minds of those\\
who are always vigilant,\\
training themselves day and night,\\
and whose lives are fully intent\\
upon liberation.

227.\\
Since ancient times it has been the case\\
that those who speak too much are criticized,\\
as are those who speak too little\\
and those who don’t speak at all.\\
Everyone in this world is criticized.

228.\\
There never was,\\
nor will there be,\\
nor is there now,\\
anybody who is only blamed\\
or wholly praised.

229.\\
Those who live impeccably,\\
who are discerning,\\
intelligent and virtuous –\\
they are continually praised by the wise.

230.\\
Who would cast blame on those\\
who in their being are like gold?\\
Even the gods praise them.

231.\\
Beware of clumsy movement\\
and be aware in your bodily conduct.\\
Renounce all devious action\\
and cultivate that which is wholesome.

232.\\
Beware of contrived utterance\\
and be aware in all that you say.\\
Renounce all cunning speech\\
and cultivate that which is wholesome.

233.\\
Beware of devious thinking\\
and be aware of all that you dwell upon.\\
Renounce all unruly thought\\
and cultivate that which is wholesome.

234.\\
Ably self-restrained\\
are the wise,\\
in action, in thought\\
and in speech.
