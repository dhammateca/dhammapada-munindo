The Elephant
============

320.\\
As an elephant in battle\\
withstands arrows,\\
I choose to endure\\
verbal attacks from others.

321.\\
Well-trained horses\\
can be trusted in crowds,\\
and are to be mounted by kings.\\
Individuals who have trained\\
themselves to withstand abuse\\
will be valuable everywhere.

322.\\
Impressive are horses or elephants\\
which have been well-trained;\\
but more impressive\\
are individuals\\
who have tamed themselves.

323.\\
It is not on a well-trained animal\\
that you can ride\\
to the land of liberation;\\
it is only on the vehicle\\
of a well-trained self\\
that you will arrive there.

324.\\
When captured and bound and in rut,\\
a wild elephant is restless, uncontrollable,\\
not eating its food.\\
It longs for its native forest home.

325.\\
It is a fool who overeats\\
and indulges in laziness,\\
then, feeling drowsy,\\
wallows in sleep like an oversized pig;\\
this forebodes perpetual suffering.

326.\\
My mind which was once\\
wild and unruly,\\
wandering as it wished,\\
I hold now in check\\
as the mahout with his hook\\
controls an elephant in rut.

327.\\
As an elephant\\
resolutely drags itself from a swamp,\\
uplift yourself with the inspiration\\
of cultivated attention.

328.\\
If you find a good companion,\\
of integrity and wisdom,\\
you will overcome all dangers\\
in joyous and caring company.

329.\\
But if you cannot find\\
a good companion\\
of integrity and wisdom,\\
then, like a king departing\\
a conquered land,\\
or an elephant wandering\\
alone in the forest,\\
walk alone.

330.\\
A harmless solitary life\\
lived at ease,\\
like that of the lone elephant in the forest,\\
is better than\\
the unnecessary company of fools.

331.\\
The timely company of friends is goodness.\\
Fewness of needs is goodness.\\
Having accumulated virtue\\
at life’s end is goodness.\\
Having dispensed\\
with all suffering is goodness.

332.\\
Rightly serving one’s parents is goodness.\\
Supporting renunciates is goodness.\\
Honouring awakened beings is goodness.

333.\\
Sustaining virtue into old age is goodness.\\
Sustaining sound faith is goodness.\\
The arising of insight is goodness.\\
Renouncing evil is goodness.
