The Buddha
==========

179.\\
The Buddha’s perfection is complete;\\
there is no more work to be done.\\
No measure is there for his wisdom;\\
no limits are there to be found.\\
In what way could he be distracted\\
from truth?

180.\\
The Buddha’s perfection is complete;\\
in him there is no craving\\
that could drag him down.\\
No measure is there for his wisdom;\\
no limits are there to be found.\\
In what way could he be distracted\\
from truth?

181.\\
Celestial beings treasure\\
the Awakened Ones\\
who have fully seen the Way,\\
who are devoted to meditation\\
and delight in the peace\\
of renunciation.

182.\\
It is not easy to be born as a human being\\
and to live this mortal life.\\
It is not easy to have the opportunity\\
to hear Dhamma\\
and rare for a Buddha to arise.

183.\\
Refrain from doing evil,\\
cultivate that which is good,\\
purify the heart.\\
This is the Way of the Awakened Ones.

184.\\
A renunciate does not\\
oppress anyone.\\
Patient endurance\\
is the ultimate asceticism.\\
Profound liberation,\\
say the Buddhas,\\
is the supreme goal.

185.\\
Not insulting, not harming,\\
cultivating restraint,\\
with respect for the training,\\
modesty in eating and contentment\\
with one’s dwelling place,\\
devotion to mindful intent:\\
this is the teaching of the Buddha.

186-187.\\
Not in great wealth\\
is there contentment,\\
nor in sensual pleasure,\\
gross or refined.\\
But in the extinction of craving\\
is joy to be found\\
by a disciple of the Buddha.

188-189.\\
To many places beings withdraw\\
to escape from fear:\\
to mountains, forests,\\
parklands and gardens;\\
sacred places as well.\\
But none of these places\\
offer true refuge,\\
none of them can free us from fear.

190-191.\\
One who finds refuge in the Buddha\\
in the Dhamma and in the Sangha\\
sees with penetrating insight\\
suffering, its cause, its release\\
and the Way leading to true freedom.

192.\\
The Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha:\\
these are the true refuge;\\
these are supreme;\\
these lead to Liberation.

193.\\
It is hard to find\\
a being of great wisdom;\\
rare are the places\\
in which they are born.\\
Those who surround them\\
when they appear\\
know good fortune indeed.

194.\\
Blessed is the arising of a Buddha;\\
blessed is the revealing of the Dhamma;\\
blessed is the concord of the Sangha;\\
delightful is harmonious communion.

195-196.\\
Immeasurable is the benefit\\
obtained from honouring those\\
who are pure and beyond fear.\\
Beings who have found freedom\\
from sorrow and grieving\\
are worthy of honour.
