Preface

*To the third edition (2010)*

This year Luang Por Sumedho has announced he will return to Thailand
after thirty-three years in Britain. Some of those whose lives have been
changed by receiving Dhamma teachings from Luang Por wish to express
their gratitude by reprinting my rendering of the Dhammapada. I am
delighted to support this.

I have taken the opportunity to make a few minor corrections and
alterations, otherwise the text of this *Dhammapada for Contemplation*
remains the same as previous editions.
