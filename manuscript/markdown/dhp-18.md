Pollution
=========

235.\\
Resembling a withered leaf,\\
you have the messenger\\
of death at your side.\\
Although a long journey lies ahead,\\
you have still made no provision.

236.\\
Hasten to cultivate wisdom;\\
make an island for yourself.\\
Freed from stain and defilement,\\
you will enter noble being.

237.\\
It is time for you to come\\
into the presence of the Lord of Death.\\
There is no time for rest on this journey,\\
yet what provision have you made?

238.\\
Hasten to cultivate wisdom;\\
make an island for yourself.\\
Freed from stain and defilement,\\
you are released from birth and death.

239.\\
Gradually, gradually,\\
a moment at a time,\\
the wise remove their own impurities\\
as a goldsmith removes the dross.

240.\\
As iron is destroyed by the rust it produces,\\
so those who perform evil are corroded\\
by their own action.

241.\\
Lack of study leads\\
to forgetting the teachings;\\
neglect spoils the home;\\
laziness leads to loss of beauty;\\
heedlessness ruins attention.

242.\\
Sexual misconduct\\
diminishes those who perform it;\\
stinginess diminishes\\
those who could give.\\
Acts that diminish their doer\\
are stains indeed.

243.\\
But the worst stain of all\\
is ignorance.\\
Be purified of this\\
and you are free.

244.\\
Life is apparently easy\\
for one who lacks shame,\\
who is as impudent as a crow,\\
who is arrogant, aggressive,\\
intrusive and corrupt.

245.\\
Life is not easy for those\\
who have a sense of shame,\\
who are modest,\\
pure-minded and detached,\\
morally upright and reflective.

246-247.\\
Whoever destroys life,\\
disregards truth,\\
is sexually irresponsible,\\
takes what is not rightfully theirs,\\
and heedlessly indulges in drugs\\
destroys the very roots\\
of their own life.

248.\\
Whoever is intent on goodness\\
should know this:\\
a lack of self-restraint is disastrous.\\
Do not allow greed and misconduct\\
to prolong your misery.

249-250.\\
People are inspired to be generous\\
according to their faith and trust.\\
If we become discontented\\
with what we have been given,\\
our meditation will be filled\\
with endless mental affliction;\\
but if we are free from this discontent,\\
our meditation is full of peace.

251.\\
There is no fire like lust,\\
no obstruction like hatred,\\
no trap like delusion,\\
and no vortex like craving.

252.\\
It is easy to see the faults of others,\\
but it takes courage to look at one’s own.\\
As with chaff,\\
one might winnow others’ shortcomings\\
while hiding one’s own;\\
as a stealthy hunter\\
might conceal himself from his prey.

253.\\
Those who always look for\\
the faults of others –\\
their corruptions increase\\
and they are far from freedom.

254.\\
No tracks are found in the air,\\
there is no liberation apart from the Way.\\
Most people tend to indulge in proliferation,\\
from which Awakened Ones are free.

255.\\
No tracks are found in the air,\\
there is no liberation apart from the Way.\\
There are no conditioned things\\
that are permanent,\\
and yet the Buddhas remain unperturbed.
