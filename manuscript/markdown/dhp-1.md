The Pairs
=========

1.\\
All states of being are determined by the heart.\\
It is the heart that leads the way.\\
Just as the wheel of the oxcart follows\\
the hoof print of the animal that draws it,\\
so suffering will surely follow\\
when we speak or act impulsively\\
from an impure heart.

2.\\
All states of being are determined by the heart.\\
It is the heart that leads the way.\\
As surely as our shadow never leaves us,\\
so well-being will follow\\
when we speak or act\\
with a pure heart.

3.\\
When we hold fast to such thoughts as,\\
“They abused me, mistreated me,\\
molested me, robbed me,”\\
we keep hatred alive.

4.\\
If we thoroughly release ourselves\\
from such thoughts as,\\
“They abused me, mistreated me,\\
molested me, robbed me,”\\
hatred is vanquished.

5.\\
Never by hatred is hatred conquered,\\
but by readiness to love alone.\\
This is eternal law.

6.\\
Those who are contentious\\
have forgotten that we all die;\\
for the wise, who reflect on this fact,\\
there are no quarrels.

7.\\
As a stormy wind can uproot a frail tree,\\
so one who holds heedlessly to pleasure,\\
who indulges in food and is indolent,\\
can be uprooted by Mara.

8.\\
As a stormy wind\\
cannot move a mountain of rock,\\
so one who contemplates\\
the reality of the body,\\
who develops faith and energy,\\
is unmoved by Mara.

9.\\
Wearing the robe of a renunciate\\
does not in itself render one pure.\\
Those who wear it and yet lack diligence\\
are heedless.

10.\\
Being possessed of self-restraint,\\
honest and diligent in conduct;\\
such a one is worthy\\
of the renunciate’s robe.

11.\\
Mistaking the false for the real\\
and the real for the false,\\
one suffers a life of falsity.

12.\\
But, seeing the false as the false\\
and the real as the real,\\
one lives in the perfectly real.

13.\\
Like rain leaking through\\
a poorly-thatched roof,\\
the unruly passions\\
seep into an untamed heart.

14.\\
As rain cannot penetrate\\
a well-thatched roof,\\
so the passions\\
cannot enter a well-trained heart.

15.\\
When we see clearly\\
our own lack of virtue\\
we are filled with grief;\\
here and hereafter we grieve.

16.\\
When we appreciate fully\\
the benefit of our own pure deeds\\
we are filled with joy;\\
here and hereafter\\
there is a celebration of joy.

17.\\
Here and hereafter\\
those who perform evil\\
create their own suffering.\\
Mental preoccupation\\
with the thought, “I have done wrong”\\
possesses their minds,\\
and they fall into chaos.

18.\\
Here and hereafter\\
those who live their lives well\\
abide in happiness.\\
They are filled\\
with a natural appreciation of virtue,\\
and they dwell in delight.

19.\\
Though one may know\\
much about Dhamma,\\
if one does not live accordingly –\\
like a cowherd\\
who covets another’s cattle –\\
one experiences none of the benefits\\
of walking the Way.

20.\\
Knowing only a little about Dhamma\\
but wholeheartedly according with it,\\
transforming the passions\\
of greed, hatred and delusion,\\
releasing all attachments to here and hereafter,\\
one will indeed experience for oneself\\
the benefits of walking the Way.
