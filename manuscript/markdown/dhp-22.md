Hell
====

306.\\
Lying leads to sorrow.\\
Concealing wrong actions\\
leads to sorrow.\\
These two acts of deceit\\
take beings\\
to the same state of woe.

307.\\
Those who wear\\
the robes of a renunciate,\\
yet harbour evil\\
and are unrestrained,\\
go to a sorrowful state.

308.\\
It would be better for a renunciate\\
to swallow molten iron\\
than to live on offerings\\
deceitfully gained.

309.\\
Accumulated sadness,\\
troubled sleep,\\
blame and remorse\\
are an adultererâ€™s lot.

310.\\
Brief is the delight\\
of the fearful adulterous couple,\\
for only painful consequences can follow.

311.\\
As *kusa* grass wrongly grasped\\
wounds the hand that holds it,\\
so the renunciate life\\
hurts those who train in it wrongly.

312.\\
Acts carelessly done,\\
practices corruptly performed,\\
the holy life lived perversely,\\
lead to little or no benefit at all.

313.\\
If anything is to be done,\\
do it well,\\
with energy and devotion;\\
the renunciate life led heedlessly\\
just stirs up the dust.

314.\\
Hurtful deeds\\
are better left undone\\
as they always lead to remorse.\\
Harmless deeds are better done\\
as no regret will follow.

315.\\
As a border city must be carefully protected,\\
so guard yourself both within and without;\\
build your defences wisely and in time.\\
If these things are not attended to\\
at the right moment,\\
great sadness will come.

316.\\
Distorted views\\
which create feelings of shame\\
about that which is not shameful,\\
or indifference\\
to that which is shameful,\\
can cause beings to descend into hell.

317.\\
Distorted views\\
which create feelings of fear\\
towards what is not actually threatening,\\
or indifference in the face\\
of that which is threatening,\\
can cause beings to descend into hell.

318.\\
Distorted views,\\
which give rise to seeing right as wrong\\
and wrong as right\\
cause beings to disintegrate.

319.\\
The clear seeing which knows\\
that which is flawed as flawed\\
and that which is pure as pure\\
can lead beings to transcend misery.
