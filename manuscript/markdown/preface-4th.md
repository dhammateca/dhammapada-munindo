Preface
=======

*To the fourth edition (2015)*

We continue to receive requests for copies of this *Dhammapada for
Contemplation* and are grateful to our good friends in Malaysia for
making a reprint possible.

As well as using resources mentioned above in earlier editions, in
adjusting some verses I have had the benefit of translations by Bhikkhu
Thanissaro and Acharya Buddharakkhita (see
[www.accesstoinsight.org](http://accesstoinsight.org)).

For those who are interested, these are the verses I have significantly
reworked: 1, 2, 36, 78, 95, 123, 141, 183, 198, 223, 231, 232, 233, 244,
331, 332, 333, 383, 384, 421. Otherwise, the text of this rendering of
the Dhammapada remains mostly the same as previous editions.

As before, I encourage readers to refer to other versions of the
Dhammapada, particularly those mentioned as resources for this book.
