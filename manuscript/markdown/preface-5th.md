Preface

*To the 5th edition (2017)*

Once more we are grateful to our good friends in Malaysia for making
another reprint of this small booklet possible.

As indicated in earlier editions, various resources have been consulted
including translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Acharya Buddharakkhita
(see [www.accesstoinsight.org](http://accesstoinsight.org)).

For those who are interested, these are some of the verses I have
reworked: 21, 22, 57, 118, 165, 380, 389, 399, 418. Readers are strongly
encouraged to refer to other versions of the Dhammapada.
