The Wise
========

76.\\
Only blessings can arise\\
from seeking the company\\
of wise and discerning persons,\\
who skilfully offer\\
both admonition and advice\\
as if guiding one to hidden treasure.

77.\\
Let the wise guide beings away from darkness,\\
give direction and advice.\\
They will be treasured by the virtuous\\
and dismissed by the foolish.

78.\\
Do not seek the company of misguided friends;\\
beware of degenerate companions.\\
Seek the company of well-guided friends,\\
those who support insight.

79.\\
Surrendering oneself to Dhamma\\
leads to serene being.\\
The wise perpetually delight in the truth\\
taught by the Awakened One.

80.\\
Those who build canals\\
channel the flow of water.\\
Arrowsmiths make arrows.\\
Woodworkers craft wood.\\
The wise tame themselves.

81.\\
As solid rock\\
is unshaken by the wind,\\
so are those with wisdom undisturbed,\\
whether by praise or blame.

82.\\
On hearing true teachings\\
the hearts of those who are receptive\\
become serene,\\
like a lake, deep, clear and still.

83.\\
Virtuous beings are unattached.\\
They do not indulge in heedless speech\\
about sensual pleasures.\\
They experience both joy and sorrow\\
but are possessed by neither.

84.\\
Neither for one’s own sake\\
nor on behalf of another\\
does a wise person do harm\\
– not for the sake of family, fortune or gain.\\
Such a one is rightly called\\
just, virtuous and wise.

85.\\
Few are those who reach the beyond.\\
Most pace endlessly back and forth,\\
not daring to risk the journey.

86.\\
Although it is difficult to cross over\\
the storm-swept sea of passion,\\
those who live in accordance\\
with the well-taught Way\\
arrive at the beyond.

87-88.\\
With an image of liberation as the goal\\
the wise abandon darkness\\
and cherish light,\\
leave petty security behind\\
and seek freedom from attachment.\\
To pursue such release is difficult and rare,\\
yet the wise will seek it,\\
detaching themselves from obstructions,\\
purifying heart and mind.

89.\\
Freeing themselves from longing,\\
unhindered by habitual grasping,\\
those who align themselves with the Way\\
delight in non-attachment\\
and, while still in the world,\\
are radiant.
