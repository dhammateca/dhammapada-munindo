Affection
=========

209.\\
There are those who pursue\\
that which should be avoided\\
and avoid that which\\
should be pursued.\\
Caught up in the senses\\
they lose their way,\\
and later envy\\
those who know the truth.

210.\\
To lose the company\\
of those with whom\\
one feels at home is painful,\\
to be associated with those\\
whom you dislike is even worse;\\
so do not abandon yourselves\\
either to the company of those\\
with whom you feel at home\\
or those whom you dislike.

211.\\
Beware of the attachment\\
that springs from fondness,\\
for separation from those\\
one holds dear is painful,\\
while if you take sides\\
neither for nor against fondness,\\
there will be no bondage.

212.\\
From endearment springs grief.\\
From endearment springs fear of loss.\\
Yet, if one is free from endearment,\\
there is no grief,\\
so how could there be fear?

213.\\
Becoming lost in affection\\
brings sorrow;\\
becoming lost in affection\\
brings fear.\\
Being free from affection\\
means sorrow ceases,\\
so how could there be any fear?

214.\\
Becoming lost in enjoyment\\
brings sorrow;\\
becoming lost in enjoyment\\
brings fear.\\
Being free in your experience of enjoyment\\
means sorrow ceases,\\
so how could there be any fear?

215.\\
Becoming lost in lust\\
brings sorrow;\\
becoming lost in lust\\
brings fear.\\
Not being lost in lust\\
means sorrow ceases,\\
so how could there be any fear?

216.\\
Becoming lost in craving\\
brings sorrow;\\
becoming lost in craving\\
brings fear.\\
Being free from craving\\
means sorrow ceases,\\
so how could there be any fear?

217.\\
Naturally held dear are those\\
who live with right action\\
and have found the Way,\\
and through insight\\
have become established in the truth.

218.\\
Those who long\\
for the undefinable,\\
with hearts filled with inspiration,\\
whose minds are freed\\
from sensual longing\\
are called\\
“those bound for freedom”.

219-220.\\
Just as family and friends\\
joyfully welcome home\\
loved ones returned from afar,\\
so their own good deeds\\
welcome those who have done them\\
as they go from this life to the next.
