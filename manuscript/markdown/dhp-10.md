Aggression
==========

129.\\
Having empathy for others,\\
one sees that all beings are afraid\\
of punishment and death.\\
Knowing this,\\
one does not attack or cause attack.

130.\\
Having empathy for others,\\
one sees that all beings\\
love life and fear death.\\
Knowing this,\\
one does not attack or cause attack.

131.\\
To harm living beings\\
who, like us, seek contentment,\\
is to bring harm to ourselves.

132.\\
To avoid bringing harm to living beings\\
who, like us, seek contentment,\\
is to bring happiness to ourselves.

133.\\
Avoid speaking harshly to others;\\
harsh speech prompts retaliation.\\
Those hurt by your words may hurt you back.

134.\\
If spoken to harshly,\\
make yourself as silent as a cracked gong;\\
non-retaliation is a sign of freedom.

135.\\
Just as a herdsman\\
drives cattle to pasture,\\
old age and death\\
direct living beings.

136.\\
Though while they perform their evil acts\\
they do not realize what they are doing,\\
fools suffer the results\\
of their own actions accordingly,\\
just as one is burnt when handling fire.

137-140.\\
To cause harm to the defenceless\\
soon brings suffering\\
to those who attack.\\
They will reap pain or poverty or loss,\\
illness, insanity or persecution,\\
abuse, distress or devastation,\\
and, alone, after death\\
they must confront their misdeeds.

141.\\
Not outer asceticisms,\\
nor self-humiliation,\\
nor physical deprivation of any kind\\
can purify oneâ€™s heart\\
if it is still obscured by doubt.

142.\\
Flamboyant outer appearance\\
does not in itself constitute\\
an obstruction to freedom.\\
Having a heart at peace,\\
pure, contained,\\
awake and blameless,\\
distinguishes a renunciate,\\
a wayfarer, a noble being.

143.\\
A well-trained horse\\
gives no cause for restraint.\\
Rare are those beings who,\\
through modesty and discipline,\\
give no cause for rebuke.

144.\\
Let the dread of endless mediocrity\\
spur you into great effort,\\
like a well-trained horse\\
encouraged by the mere touch of the whip.\\
Relinquish the burden of endless struggle\\
with unapologetic confidence,\\
with purity of action, effort, concentration,\\
and by conscious and disciplined commitment\\
to the path.

145.\\
Those who build canals\\
channel the flow of water.\\
Fletchers make arrows.\\
Woodworkers craft wood.\\
The good tame themselves.
