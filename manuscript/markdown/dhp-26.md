Great Being
===========

383.\\
Diligently cut off\\
the stream of craving\\
and abandon sensual longings;\\
knowing the inherent limitations\\
of all that is formed,\\
realize the uncreated.

384.\\
All chains of confinement fall away\\
from those who see clearly\\
beyond the two.

385.\\
I say a being is great\\
who stands not on this shore,\\
nor the other shore,\\
nor on any shore at all.\\
Such a being is free from all ties.

386.\\
I say a being is great\\
who dwells secluded and at ease,\\
knowing the heart\\
free from all pollution,\\
having completed the task,\\
purified of all compulsive tendencies\\
and awake.

387.\\
The sun shines by day,\\
the moon shines by night.\\
But both all day and all night\\
the Buddha shines\\
in glorious splendour.

388.\\
Having transformed evil,\\
one is called a great being.\\
Living peacefully,\\
one is called a contemplative.\\
Having given up impurity,\\
one is called a renunciate.

389.\\
Non-retaliation\\
is the characteristic of great beings.\\
They do not give rise to anger.\\
Should they be attacked,\\
it is not in their nature to strike back.

390.\\
Suffering subsides to the degree\\
that you are free from the intention\\
to cause harm.\\
There is no real greatness\\
if there is no restraint of anger.

391.\\
One who refrains from causing harm\\
by way of body, speech or mind,\\
can be called a worthy being.

392.\\
Devotion and respect\\
should be offered to those\\
who have shown us the Way.

393.\\
One should not be considered\\
worthy of respect\\
because of birth or background,\\
or any outer sign;\\
it is purity\\
and the realization of truth\\
that determine one’s worth.

394.\\
Your outer adornments\\
and pseudo-spiritual preoccupations\\
are irrelevant\\
if inwardly you remain in disarray.

395.\\
To be unconcerned\\
about outer appearance\\
but committed to\\
intense relentless practice\\
makes for greatness.

396.\\
No one is noble\\
merely because of what they inherit.\\
Nobility comes from cleansing oneself\\
of all pollutions\\
and attachments.

397.\\
Whoever has cut all that tethers\\
and found fearlessness,\\
who is beyond attachments\\
and defilements,\\
I recognize as a great being.

398.\\
Whoever severs the ties of hatred,\\
unbinds the ropes of craving,\\
undoes the locks of wrong view,\\
opens the doors of ignorance\\
and sees truth,\\
I recognize as a great being.

399.\\
Strength of patience\\
is the might of noble beings;\\
they can be shackled,\\
endure verbal abuse and beatings,\\
without resorting to anger.

400.\\
Those who are free from anger,\\
simply disciplined, virtuous,\\
well-trained\\
and have gone beyond rebirth,\\
these I call great beings.

401.\\
As water slides from a lotus leaf,\\
so sensual pleasures\\
do not cling\\
to a great being.

402.\\
Those who know the freedom\\
of having laid aside\\
the burden of attachment\\
to the body-mind\\
I call great beings.

403.\\
Those possessed of deep wisdom,\\
who see what accords with the Way\\
and what does not,\\
those who have attained\\
to the peak of possibility,\\
I call great beings.

404.\\
Those who are free from attachment\\
to the company of either householders\\
or fellow renunciates,\\
and so wander free from desires\\
or concern for security of any kind,\\
are great beings.

405.\\
Those who have renounced\\
the use of force\\
in relationship to other beings,\\
whether weak or strong,\\
who neither kill\\
nor cause to be killed,\\
can be called great beings.

406.\\
Those who remain\\
friendly amid the hostile,\\
at peace among the aggressive,\\
and who do not attach themselves\\
to that upon which others depend\\
are great beings.

407.\\
For a great being,\\
lust and ill-will,\\
arrogance and conceit\\
drop away,\\
even as a tiny seed would drop\\
from the tip of a needle.

408.\\
Those who speak truth\\
and give gentle encouragement,\\
contending with no-one,\\
these do I call great beings.

409.\\
The actions of a great being are pure.\\
Great beings never\\
knowingly take for themselves\\
that which belongs to another.

410.\\
The heart of a great being is free.\\
Great beings no longer pine\\
for things of this world\\
or any other world.

411.\\
The heart of a great being is free.\\
With accurate understanding\\
which is beyond doubt,\\
great beings have set their feet firmly\\
in the land of liberation.

412.\\
Whoever has transcended\\
all ties of good and bad,\\
is purified\\
and free from sorrow,\\
should be called a great being.

413.\\
Those beings who\\
are released from all longing\\
and, like the moon in a cloudless sky,\\
are pure, clear and serene,\\
I call great.

414.\\
There are beings\\
who travel the difficult path\\
across the dangerous swamp\\
of defiling passions,\\
traverse the ocean of delusion,\\
through the darkness of ignorance,\\
and go beyond.\\
They are sustained\\
by wise contemplation,\\
secure in freedom from doubt,\\
liberated;\\
such beings are great indeed.

415.\\
It is a great being\\
who, having restrained desires\\
for sensual pleasure,\\
lives the homeless life\\
and realizes freedom\\
from both sensual desire\\
and perpetual becoming.

416.\\
It is a great being\\
who, having restrained all craving,\\
lives the homeless life\\
and realizes freedom\\
from both craving\\
and perpetual becoming.

417.\\
It is a great being\\
who can see through all obvious delights\\
as well as subtle pleasures,\\
to be free from attachment.

418.\\
One who has ceased\\
from following like and dislike,\\
who is cooled,\\
who is not swayed\\
by worldly conditions –\\
I call a great being.

419.\\
I say anyone who understands fully\\
the passing away and arising of beings,\\
who remains aware,\\
non-attached, awake,\\
who is conscious of\\
right action at all times,\\
is a great being.

420.\\
The condition after death\\
of great beings is indiscernible;\\
no trace of passion remains.\\
They are pure.

421.\\
Anyone who lives freed\\
from habits of clinging\\
to past, present or future,\\
attaching to nothing,\\
is a great being.

422.\\
A great being is fearless like a bull,\\
noble, strong, wise, diligent,\\
sees through delusions,\\
is clear, attentive and awake.

423.\\
To understand all dimensions\\
of past existence,\\
to see accurately into all realms,\\
to reach the end of rebirths,\\
to know with insight\\
that which must be known,\\
to free the heart from ignorance –\\
this is truly being made great.
