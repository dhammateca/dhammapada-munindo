It is wisdom\\
that enables letting go\\
of a lesser happiness\\
in pursuit of a happiness\\
which is greater.

291.\\
You fail\\
in the pursuit of happiness\\
if it is at the expense\\
of others’ well-being.\\
The snare of ill-will\\
can still entangle you.

292.\\
To leave undone\\
that which should be done\\
and to do that\\
which should be avoided\\
leads to carelessness and conceit.\\
It will increase confusion.

293.\\
Confusion ceases\\
by maintaining\\
a meditation practice\\
focused in the body,\\
by avoiding that\\
which should not be done\\
and by mindfully doing\\
that which should be done.

294.\\
By removing craving and conceit,\\
eradicating wrong views,\\
and overcoming\\
the deluded attachments of the sense realm,\\
the noble being moves freely on.

295.\\
Having cleared\\
all the hindrances to the Path –\\
greed, rage, dullness and laziness,\\
worry, anxiety and doubt –\\
the noble being freely moves on.

296.\\
Disciples of the Buddha\\
are fully awake,\\
dwelling both day and night\\
in contemplation of the Awakened One.

297.\\
Disciples of the Buddha\\
are fully awake,\\
dwelling both day and night\\
in contemplation of reality.

298.\\
Disciples of the Buddha\\
are fully awake,\\
dwelling both day and night\\
in contemplation of the communion\\
of beings who have awakened.

299.\\
Disciples of the Buddha\\
are fully awake,\\
dwelling both day and night\\
in contemplation of\\
the true nature of the body.

300.\\
Disciples of the Buddha\\
are fully awake\\
both day and night,\\
taking delight in compassion.

301.\\
Disciples of the Buddha\\
are fully awake\\
both day and night,\\
taking delight\\
in cultivating the heart.

302.\\
It is hard to live\\
the life of renunciation;\\
its challenges\\
are difficult to find pleasant.\\
Yet it is also hard to live\\
the householder’s life;\\
there is pain\\
when associating with those\\
among whom one feels no companionship.\\
To wander uncommitted\\
is always going to be difficult;\\
why not renounce\\
the deluded pursuit of pain?

303.\\
A traveller possessed of virtue,\\
disciplined and committed to right conduct,\\
will be received with honour;\\
such a one can be recognised\\
and can travel with confidence.

304.\\
The good\\
are seen even from afar.\\
They shine like the distant\\
Himalayan peaks.\\
The untrained simply disappear\\
like arrows shot into the dark.

305.\\
With enthusiasm establish yourself\\
in solitary practice –\\
sit alone, sleep alone, walk alone\\
and delight as if secluded in the forest.
