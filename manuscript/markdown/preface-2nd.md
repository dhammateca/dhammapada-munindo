Preface

*To the second edition (2006)*

Over five years have passed since we printed the first edition of this
*Dhammapada for Contemplation*. I am happy that the first edition was
met with so much appreciation. Now, on the occasion of celebrating 25
years since the establishing of Aruna Ratanagiri Monastery here on
Harnham Hill, it is a joy to have an opportunity for a reprint. It has
also been an opportunity to re-craft some of the verses.

I am indebted to Thanissaro Bhikkhu for his new translation of *The
Dhammapada* (Dhamma Dana Pubs. Barre, Ma.1998) which was usefully
consulted. I am most grateful to all those who offered comments on this
new edition.
