The Foolish
===========

60.\\
The night is long\\
for one who cannot sleep.\\
A journey is long for one who is tired.\\
Ignorant existence is long and tedious\\
for those unaware of Truth.

61.\\
Having found no companion\\
who has travelled at least as far as ourselves,\\
it is better to go alone\\
than to accompany those\\
who remain irresolute.

62.\\
“This is my child, this is my wealth”:\\
such thoughts are the preoccupations of fools.\\
If we are unable to own even ourselves,\\
why make such claims?

63.\\
The fool who knows he is a fool\\
is at least a little wise;\\
the fool who thinks that he is wise\\
is assuredly a fool.

64.\\
Like spoons unable to taste\\
the flavour of the soup\\
are the fools who cannot see truth,\\
even though they live\\
all their lives among the wise.

65.\\
Like the tongue that can appreciate\\
the flavour of the soup\\
is one who can clearly discern the truth\\
after only a brief\\
association with the wise.

66.\\
By heedlessly performing evil,\\
unwary fools produce their own bitter fruits.\\
They behave like their worst enemy.

67.\\
A deed is not well-done\\
when upon reflection remorse arises:\\
with tears of sorrow\\
one harvests its fruit.

68.\\
A deed is well-done\\
when upon reflection no remorse arises:\\
with joy one harvests its fruits.

69.\\
Fools perceive evil acts\\
to be sweet as honey\\
until they have seen the consequences.\\
When they behold their fruits,\\
fools suffer indeed.

70.\\
Even after months of rigid asceticism,\\
subsisting on a frugal diet,\\
a fool is not to be compared in value\\
to the person who simply sees the truth.

71.\\
Fresh milk does not immediately\\
turn into curd,\\
and evil acts do not immediately\\
show their fruits;\\
however, fools do suffer from the consequences\\
of their foolishness\\
as they would be burned\\
by standing on coals hidden in ashes.

72.\\
Fools are those who use foolishly\\
whatever gifts they have,\\
destroying their accumulated good fortune.

73-74.\\
The conceit and craving of fools grows\\
as they claim for themselves\\
undue authority, recognition and reward:\\
their falsity affects their longing,\\
they wish to be seen\\
as powerful and discerning.

75.\\
Like the tongue that can appreciate\\
the flavour of the soup,\\
is one who can discern clearly the truth\\
after only a brief\\
association with the wise.
