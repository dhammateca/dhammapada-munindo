\chapter[Preface to the fifth edition (2016)]{Preface}

Once more we are grateful to our good friends in Malaysia for making another
reprint of this small booklet possible.

As with earlier editions several resources have been consulted including 
translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Acharya Buddharakkhita 
(see \href{http://accesstoinsight.org}{www.accesstoinsight.org}).

For those who are interested, these are the verses I have significantly
reworked: 21, 22, 57, 118, 418. Otherwise, the text of this rendering of the
Dhammapada remains mostly the same as previous editions. Readers are strongly
encouraged to refer to other versions of the Dhammapada.
