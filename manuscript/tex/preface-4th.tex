\chapter[Preface to the fourth edition (2015)]{Preface}

We continue to receive requests for copies of this \emph{Dhammapada for
Contemplation} and are grateful to our good friends in Malaysia for making a
reprint possible.

As well as using resources mentioned above in earlier editions, in adjusting
some verses I have had the benefit of translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and
Acharya Buddharakkhita (see
\href{http://accesstoinsight.org}{www.accesstoinsight.org}).

For those who are interested, these are the verses I have significantly
reworked: 1, 2, 36, 78, 95, 123, 141, 183, 198, 223, 231, 232, 233, 244, 331,
332, 333, 383, 384, 421. Otherwise, the text of this rendering of the Dhammapada
remains mostly the same as previous editions.

As before, I encourage readers to refer to other versions of the Dhammapada,
particularly those mentioned as resources for this book.
