\chapter[Preface to the fourth edition (2015)]{Preface}

We continue to receive requests for copies of this \emph{Dhammapada for Contemplation} and are grateful to our good friends in Malaysia for making a reprint possible.

Once again I have taken the opportunity to adjust a few of the verses. As well as the resources mentioned above in earlier editions I have had the benefit of translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Acharya Buddharakkhita.

% TODO: mention that I removed "(see www.accesstoinsight.org)"

For those who are interested, these are the verses I have significantly reworked: 1, 2, 36, 78, 95, 123, 141, 183, 198, 223, 231, 232, 233, 244, 331, 332, 333, 383, 384,421. Otherwise, the text of this rendering of the Dhammapada remains mostly the same as previous editions.

As before, I encourage readers to refer to other versions of The Dhammapada, particularly those mentioned as resources for this book.
