\chapter{The Elephant}


\verseref{320}
As an elephant in battle\\
withstands arrows,\\
I choose to endure\\
verbal attacks from others.


\verseref{321}
Well-trained horses\\
can be trusted in crowds,\\
and are to be mounted by kings.\\
Individuals who have trained\\
themselves to withstand abuse\\
will be valuable everywhere.

\verseref{322}
Impressive are horses or elephants\\
which have been well-trained;\\
but more impressive\\
are individuals\\
who have tamed themselves.


\verseref{323}
It is not on a well-trained animal\\
that you can ride\\
to the land of liberation;\\
it is only on the vehicle\\
of a well-trained self\\
that you will arrive there.


\verseref{324}
When captured and bound and in rut,\\
a wild elephant is restless, uncontrollable,\\
not eating its food.\\
It longs for its native forest home.

\verseref{325}
It is a fool who overeats\\
and indulges in laziness,\\
then, feeling drowsy,\\
wallows in sleep like an oversized pig;\\
this forebodes perpetual suffering.


\verseref{326}
My mind which was once\\
wild and unruly,\\
wandering as it wished,\\
I hold now in check\\
as the mahout with his hook\\
controls an elephant in rut.


\verseref{327}
As an elephant\\
resolutely drags itself from a swamp,\\
uplift yourself with the inspiration\\
of cultivated attention.

\verseref{328}
If you find a good companion,\\
of integrity and wisdom,\\
you will overcome all dangers\\
in joyous and caring company.


\verseref{329}
But if you cannot find\\
a good companion\\
of integrity and wisdom,\\
then, like a king departing\\
a conquered land,\\
or an elephant wandering\\
alone in the forest,\\
walk alone.


\verseref{330}
A harmless solitary life\\
lived at ease,\\
like that of the lone elephant in the forest,\\
is better than\\
the unnecessary company of fools.


\verseref{331}
The timely company of friends is goodness.\\
Fewness of needs is goodness.\\
Having accumulated virtue\\
at lifeâ€™s end is goodness.\\
Having dispensed\\
with all suffering is goodness.


\verseref{332}
Rightly serving one's parents is goodness.\\
Supporting renunciates is goodness.\\
Honouring awakened beings is goodness.


\verseref{333}
Sustaining virtue into old age is goodness.\\
Sustaining sound faith is goodness.\\
The arising of insight is goodness.\\
Renouncing evil is goodness.
