\chapter[Preface to the second edition (2006)]{Preface}

Over five years have passed since we printed the first edition of this \emph{Dhammapada for Contemplation}. I am happy that the first edition was met with so much appreciation. Now, on the occasion of celebrating 25 years since the establishing of Aruna Ratanagiri Monastery here on Harnham Hill, it is a joy to have an opportunity for a reprint. It has also been an opportunity to re-craft some of  the verses.

I am indebted to Thanissaro Bhikkhu for his new translation of \emph{The Dhammapada} (Dhamma Dana Pubs. Barre, MA.1998) which was usefully consulted. I am most grateful to all those who offered comments on this new edition.
