\chapter{The World}


\verseref{167}
By renouncing unworthy ways\\
and by not living carelessly,\\
by not holding to false views,\\
we no longer perpetuate delusion.


\verseref{168}
Do not show false humility.\\
Stand firmly in relation to your goal.\\
Practice, well-observed,\\
leads to contentment\\
both now and in the future.


\verseref{169}
Live your life well in accord with the Way --\\
avoid a life of distraction.\\
A life well-lived leads to contentment\\
both now and in the future.


\verseref{170}
The King of Death cannot find\\
those who look upon the world\\
as insubstantial,\\
as transient, a bubble --\\
illusive, only a mirage.


\verseref{171}
Come, view this world.\\
See it as an ornate festive carriage.\\
See how fools are entranced by their visions,\\
yet for the wise there is no attachment.


\verseref{172}
There are those\\
who awaken from heedlessness.\\
They bring light into the world\\
like the moon\\
emerging from clouds.


\verseref{173}
One who transforms old and heedless ways\\
into fresh and wholesome acts\\
brings light into the world\\
like the moon freed from clouds.


\verseref{174}
If birds are trapped in a net\\
only a few will ever escape.\\
In this world of illusion\\
only a few see their way to liberation.


\verseref{175}
White swans rise into the air.\\
Adept yogis\\
transport themselves through space.\\
Wise beings\\
transcend worldly delusion\\
by outwitting the hordes of Mara.


\verseref{176}
For one who transgresses\\
the law of truthfulness,\\
one who has no regard\\
for a future existence,\\
there is no manner of evil\\
that is impossible.


\verseref{177}
Those who fail to value generosity\\
do not reach the celestial realms.\\
But the wise rejoice in giving\\
and forever abide in bliss.


\verseref{178}
Better than ruling the whole world,\\
better than going to heaven,\\
better than lordship over the universe,\\
is an irreversible commitment to the Way.
