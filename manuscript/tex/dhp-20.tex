\chapter{The Path}


\verseref{273}
The Eightfold Path\\
is the most honourable way,\\
the Four Noble Truths\\
the most honourable utterance,\\
freedom from craving\\
the most honourable state,\\
and the all-seeing Buddha\\
the most honourable being.


\verseref{274}
This is the only Way;\\
there is no other\\
that leads to clear seeing.\\
Follow this Way\\
and Mara becomes disoriented.


\verseref{275}
If you walk the path\\
you will arrive at the end of suffering.\\
Having beheld this myself,\\
I proclaim the Way\\
which removes all thorns.


\verseref{276}
The Awakened Ones\\
can but point the way;\\
we must make the effort ourselves.\\
Those who reflect wisely\\
and enter the path are freed\\
from the fetters of Mara.


\verseref{277}
“All conditioned things\\
are impermanent”;\\
when we see this with insight\\
we will tire of this life of suffering.\\
This is the Way to purification.


\verseref{278}
“All conditioned things\\
are inherently lacking”;\\
when we see this with insight\\
we will tire of this life of suffering.\\
This is the Way to purification.


\verseref{279}
“All realities are devoid\\
of an abiding self”;\\
when we see this with insight\\
we will tire of this life of suffering.\\
This is the Way to purification.


\verseref{280}
If, while still young and strong,\\
you procrastinate\\
when you should act,\\
indulging in heedless fantasies,\\
the Way and its wisdom\\
will never become clear.


\verseref{281}
Be careful in what you say,\\
restrained in what you think,\\
and impeccable in how you act.\\
Purifying these three ways of behaviour\\
will take you along the Way of the sages.


\verseref{282}
To contemplate life leads to wisdom;\\
without contemplation wisdom wanes.\\
Recognize how wisdom\\
is cultivated and destroyed,\\
and walk the Way of increase.


\verseref{283}
Clear away the forests of craving,\\
but do not attack and destroy the trees.\\
Clear the entire forest of craving\\
and you will see the Way to freedom.


\verseref{284}
So long as sexual attraction\\
has not been cleared away,\\
if even the slightest trace remains,\\
the heart is held in dependence\\
like a suckling calf to a cow.


\verseref{285}
Remove the bonds of affection\\
as one might pluck an autumn flower.\\
Walk the Way that leads to liberation,\\
explained by the Awakened One.


\verseref{286}
It is a fool\\
who indulges in dreaming\\
about the most comfortable\\
place to live, saying,\\
“Here it will be warm,\\
there it will be cool” --\\
unaware of impending death.


\verseref{287}
As a flood could sweep away\\
an entire village,\\
those who are caught up\\
in relationships and possessions\\
will be carried away by death.


\verseref{288-289}
As you approach death\\
none of your fond attachments\\
will protect you.\\
See this, then with wise restraint\\
and unwavering effort,\\
hasten to clear your path to liberation.
