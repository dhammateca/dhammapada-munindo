\chapter{The Mind}


\verseref{33}
Just as a fletcher shapes an arrow,\\
so the wise develop the mind,\\
so excitable, uncertain\\
and difficult to control.

\verseref{34}
As a fish which on being dragged\\
from its home in the water\\
and tossed on dry land\\
will thrash about,\\
so will the heart tremble\\
when withdrawing from the current of Mara.


\verseref{35}
The active mind is difficult to tame,\\
flighty and wandering wherever it wills:\\
taming it is essential,\\
leading to the joy of well-being.


\verseref{36}
The protected and guarded mind\\
leads to ease of being.\\
Though this mind is subtle, elusive and difficult to see,\\
one who is alert should tend\\
and watch over it.


\verseref{37}
Wandering far and wide on its own,\\
without form,\\
the mind lies in the heart-cavern within.\\
To bring it under control\\
is to be freed from the bonds of ignorance.


\verseref{38}
In one whose mind is unsteady,\\
whose heart is not prepared\\
with true teachings,\\
whose faith is not matured,\\
the fullness of wisdom is not yet manifest.


\verseref{39}
There is no fear\\
if the heart is uncontaminated\\
by the passions\\
and the mind is free from ill-will.\\
Seeing beyond good and evil,\\
one is awake.

\verseref{40}
Seeing this body to be as fragile as a clay vessel,\\
and fortifying the heart like a city wall,\\
one can confront Mara with the weapon of insight.\\
Having the advantage of non-attachment,\\
one protects what has already been gained.


\verseref{41}
Certainly this body will soon lie lifeless:\\
cast aside on the ground,\\
devoid of consciousness\\
and as useless as a burnt-out log.


\verseref{42}
More than a thief,\\
more than an enemy,\\
a misdirected heart\\
brings one to harm.


\verseref{43}
Neither mother, father\\
nor any member of a family\\
can give you the blessings generated\\
by your own well-directed heart.
