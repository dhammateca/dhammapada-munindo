\chapter{Evil}


\verseref{116}
Hasten towards doing what is wholesome.\\
Restrain your mind from evil acts.\\
The mind that is slow to do good\\
can easily find pleasure in evil-doing.


\verseref{117}
If you perform an evil act,\\
then do not repeat it.\\
Avoid finding pleasure in its memory.\\
The aftermath of evil-doing is painful.


\verseref{118}
Having performed a wholesome act\\
it is good to repeat it.\\
Enjoy the pleasure of its memory.\\
The fruit of goodness is contentment.


\verseref{119}
Even those who perform evil\\
can experience well-being\\
so long as their actions\\
have not yet borne direct fruits.\\
However, when the results\\
of their actions ripen,\\
the painful consequences\\
cannot be avoided.


\verseref{120}
Even those who live wholesome lives\\
can experience suffering\\
so long as their acts\\
have not yet borne direct fruit.\\
However, when the fruits\\
of their actions ripen,\\
the joyful consequences\\
cannot be avoided.


\verseref{121}
Do not ignore the effects of evil,\\
saying, "This will come to nothing."\\
Just as by the gradual fall of raindrops\\
the water jar is filled,\\
so in time fools are corrupted\\
by evil-doing.

\verseref{122}
Do not ignore the effect of right action\\
saying, "This will come to nothing."\\
Just as by the gradual fall of raindrops\\
the water jar is filled,\\
so in time the wise\\
become replete with good.


\verseref{123}
As a trader with valuable cargo avoids threat\\
and those who love life avoid poison,\\
so you should avoid evil actions.


\verseref{124}
A hand without an open wound\\
can carry poison\\
and remain free from harm;\\
likewise, evil has no consequences\\
for those who do not perform it.


\verseref{125}
If you intentionally harm\\
an innocent person,\\
someone who is pure and blameless,\\
the harm will come back to you\\
like fine dust thrown into the wind.


\verseref{126}
Some are reborn as humans;\\
evil-doers are reborn in hell.\\
Doers of good are reborn in bliss\\
and the pure enter the trackless land.


\verseref{127}
There is no place on earth\\
where one can hide\\
from the consequences of evil actions --\\
not in a mountain cave,\\
the ocean, nor in the sky.


\verseref{128}
There is no place on earth\\
beyond the reach of death --\\
not in a mountain cave,\\
the ocean, nor in the sky.
