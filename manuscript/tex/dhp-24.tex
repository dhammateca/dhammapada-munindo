\verseref{334}
Uncontained craving\\
grows like a creeper in the forest.\\
Being lost in it,\\
one leaps around\\
like a tree-dwelling ape looking for fruit.


\verseref{335}
Fostering habits\\
such as craving and clinging\\
is like fertilizing noxious weeds.


\verseref{336}
As water falls from a lotus leaf,\\
so sorrow drops from those\\
who are free of toxic craving.


\verseref{337}
Torrential rains can destroy crops.\\
Mara can destroy you.\\
Thus I implore you --\\
dig up the roots of all craving.\\
I give you my blessing\\
for this work.


\verseref{338}
If the roots are not removed,\\
a tree grows again and again;\\
suffering returns to us\\
so long as craving remains.


\verseref{339}
When the streams\\
of sensual pleasure run strong\\
they can generate\\
a torrent of longing.


\verseref{340}
The streams of craving flow everywhere.\\
The wild creeper of craving\\
spreads and entangles.\\
Discerning this creeper with insight,\\
dig it out.


\verseref{341}
Beings naturally experience pleasure;\\
but when pleasure is\\
contaminated with craving,\\
not releasing it creates frustration\\
and tedious suffering follows.


\verseref{342}
Trapped in habits of craving,\\
people panic\\
like rabbits caught in a snare.\\
Their reactions reinforce the pain\\
of their entrapment.


\verseref{343}
Trapped in habits of craving,\\
people panic\\
like rabbits caught in a snare.\\
If you wish to be free from entrapment,\\
craving itself must be removed.


\verseref{344}
There are those who have begun\\
on the path to freedom,\\
yet out of desire return to bondage.


\verseref{345-346}
Wisdom sees\\
that being held behind bars\\
or bound by chains\\
is less limiting\\
than infatuation with possessions\\
and obsession with relationships.\\
These bonds, though not so obvious,\\
are strong and hold us down.\\
To renounce attachment\\
to the world of the senses\\
is to be free from the prison of craving.


\verseref{347}
Like a spider caught in its own web,\\
a being enwrapped in sensual craving\\
must be released from its own longings\\
before it can walk free.


\verseref{348}
Let go of the past.\\
Let go of the future.\\
Let go of the present.\\
With a heart that is free,\\
cross over to that shore\\
which is beyond suffering.


\verseref{349}
The bonds\\
of deluded habits and craving\\
are strengthened\\
by one who lets the mind heedlessly dwell\\
on objects of desire.


\verseref{350}
But one who delights\\
in calming sensual thoughts,\\
who is alert\\
and cultivates awareness\\
of the loathsome\\
aspects of the body,\\
breaks through craving\\
and unbinds deluded habits.


\verseref{351}
No more need is there to re-form\\
for those who have reached the goal;\\
they are free from fear and longing.\\
The thorns of existence have been removed.


\verseref{352}
A master is one who has let go\\
of all craving and clinging to the world;\\
who has seen\\
the truth beyond forms,\\
yet is possessed of\\
a profound knowledge of words.\\
Such a great being can be said\\
to have finished the task.


\verseref{353}
I do not declare another as my teacher,\\
since by myself have I arrived\\
at the wisdom that overcomes all,\\
realizes all, renounces all.\\
Wholly liberated am I from all craving.


\verseref{354}
The gift of truth excels all gifts.\\
The flavour of reality\\
surpasses all flavours.\\
The delight of truth\\
transcends all delights.\\
Freedom from craving\\
is the end of all suffering.


\verseref{355}
Riches mostly ruin the foolish,\\
but not those who seek the beyond.\\
Just as they dismiss\\
the well-being of others and cause harm,\\
fools also ruin themselves.


\verseref{356}
Weeds cause damage in fields.\\
Lust causes damage to all beings.\\
Support those who are free from lust;\\
the gift will yield great benefit.


\verseref{357}
Weeds cause damage in fields.\\
Hatred causes damage to all beings.\\
Support those who are free from hatred;\\
the gift will yield great benefit.


\verseref{358}
Weeds cause damage in fields.\\
Confusion causes damage to all beings.\\
Support those who are free from confusion;\\
the gift will yield great benefit.


\verseref{359}
Weeds cause damage in fields.\\
Envy causes damage to all beings.\\
Encourage those who are free from envy\\
and there will be great benefit.
