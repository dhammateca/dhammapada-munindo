It is my hope that this \emph{Dhammapada for Contemplation} will delight those who come across it and serve to encourage further viewings from different perspectives. I trust that whatever glimpses of truth may be gained, however briefly, will encourage all travellers to continue faring on.

Any gratitude arising from the reading should be directed towards the earlier translators on whose work I have been wholly dependent: Daw Mya Tin and  the editors of the  Burmese Pitaka association (1987), Ven. Narada Thera (B.M.S. 1978), and Ven. Ananda Maitreya Thera  (Lotsawa 1988); also to the many friends whose contributions have added richness and depth; especially Ajahn Thiradhammo, Sister Medhanandi, Bani Shorter and Thomas Jones.

Responsibility for any defects that may remain rests with me.
